</div>

<p><i>At the Centenary of the birth of Sir Walter
Scott, in the year 1871, a sketch of the
Ballantyne Press was issued, setting forth its
close connection with him, and giving statistics of
the Novels. But the story of the Press, its rise
and vicissitudes under the control of James Ballantyne
and Sir Walter, its progress and development,
and its collapse and new birth, as gleaned
from Lockhart’s “Life of Scott” and other
sources, has not been given in a succinct form.
For this purpose the late Mr. W. T. Dobson, for
some forty years one of the principal Readers at
the Press, gathered together considerable material
which it has been thought might prove to be of
general interest. The Press has therefore, with
the assistance of Mr. W. L. Carrie, M.A., put
the story into its present book-form.</i></p>

<h1>THE BALLANTYNE PRESS</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="smaller">ORIGIN OF THE HOUSE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The History of the Art of Printing in
Edinburgh shows periods of fluctuating
progress—times of decadence and revival—at
recurring intervals. These are found in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and
towards the close of the eighteenth century
another period of decadence seems to have
arisen, although a few of the printers in the
city strove to maintain the fairer traditions of
the art and did good work. Among these
it is interesting to note that the firms of
Neill &amp; Co., Pillans &amp; Wilson, and Oliver &amp;
Boyd are survivors of that far-off time.</p>

<p>With the origin of the Ballantyne Press at
Kelso in 1796, and its removal a few years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
afterwards to Paul’s Work in Edinburgh, a
revival took place which inaugurated a new
era for printing in Scotland. The advent
of James Ballantyne was productive of great
changes, as he helped to diffuse a taste for
correct and elegant workmanship till then
comparatively unknown. Curwen, in his
“History of Booksellers,” referring to the
high level of English typography, mentions
the Ballantynes of Edinburgh as founding
a press, the excellent work of which had
gained the good-will of many authors and
publishers both in Edinburgh and London.</p>

</figure>

<p>James Ballantyne was the son of a merchant
in the Border town of Kelso, and was
born in 1772. He was educated at the
grammar-school of that town, then kept by
Lancelot Whale, an admirable scholar and
teacher, who is said to have resembled Dominie
Sampson in “Guy Mannering.” For a short
time in 1783 James had as schoolfellow and
companion the youthful Walter Scott, who
was staying at Rosebank for the benefit
of his health. The two became associated,
perhaps to the neglect of their tasks during
school hours, through the story-telling propensities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of Scott.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> After school they would
wander along the banks of the Tweed, and
these rambles had many pleasant associations—the
one happy in drinking in the romantic
stories and legendary lore which the other
was equally happy in pouring out. This
school friendship was never broken off, as
Scott paid frequent visits to the Border
town for some years afterwards; and when
James Ballantyne went to Edinburgh to
complete his legal training, after finishing
his apprenticeship in Kelso, it is more than
probable that he would meet Walter Scott,
who was then attending the law-classes of
the University. The intercourse would be
renewed in the class-rooms and also in the
monthly symposiums of the Teviotdale Club,
to which they both belonged. On the conclusion
of his legal studies, James Ballantyne
commenced business as a lawyer in Edinburgh,
but success proving slow he returned in 1795
to his native town; and here, whatever legal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
or other work he may have carried on, he
seems, according to an advertisement in
No. 1 of the <i>Kelso Mail</i>, to have acted as
agent for the Sun Fire Insurance Co. Being
a young man of literary ability as well, he
soon attracted the attention of the county
people, who prevailed upon him, in 1796,
to become the editor and manager of a new
weekly newspaper, the <i>Kelso Mail</i>, which
they were promoting in opposition to the
<i>Kelso Chronicle</i>, a paper of advanced democratic
principles, circulating in Roxburgh
and the other Border counties. In this way
he established his first practical connection
with printing.</p>

</figure>

<p>In the prospectus of the paper given
in No. 1, April 13, 1797, there occurs this
paragraph: “In the Miscellany we present to
the Public, it shall be our endeavour to combine
amusement with information. Literary
speculations, poetical productions of merit,
extracts from popular works, and interesting
anecdotes, shall occasionally be called in to
relieve the more important details, which
they shall not, however, in any instance be
suffered to supersede. In this department of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
our undertaking, we hope from the arrangements
we have made, to be able to furnish to
the Public a species of entertainment, which
will be a source of innocent and agreeable
relaxation, while it will afford an opportunity
for those of our young countrymen who are
partial to the lighter species of literature,
to indulge the excursions of their fancy,
and ascertain, without abusing their time,
how far they may be qualified to succeed in
pleasing the Public.”</p>

<p>The somewhat lengthy Prospectus does
not parade the usual phrase about “the felt
want,” but it implies it all the same, and it
is pleasant to record that the <i>Kelso Mail</i> is
still flourishing, having published its centenary
number in April 1897. By the courtesy
of the present proprietor, there is given here
a reduced facsimile of the first page of No. 1.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the new paper James
Ballantyne had to make several journeys—first
to London, to arrange for correspondents,
and also to Edinburgh and Glasgow, in order
to obtain type and other printing appliances—Glasgow
at that time having one of the
best type-foundries in the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>In October 1799, when Walter Scott was
returning from a ballad-hunting raid through
Ettrick Forest and Liddesdale, he stayed at
Rosebank in Kelso for some days, and the
school friends again met. Scott had recently
published translations of the German ballads
of Bürger—“Lenore” and “The Wild
Huntsman,”—through the publishing house
of Manners &amp; Miller of Edinburgh. This
little book had been well received in Scotland,
but had gained no general acceptance
in the south. It had led, however, to a
correspondence with a few who were interested
in ballad lore, especially with Matthew
Gregory Lewis (known generally as “Monk”
Lewis), who was then engaged upon a similar
work called “Tales of Wonder,” but who had
delayed its progress in such a way as to cause
considerable annoyance to Scott and to others
who had promised their aid.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In the meantime
it happened that, while Scott was at
Rosebank, James Ballantyne called one morning
and asked him to supply a few paragraphs
on some legal question of the day for his
newspaper. Scott complied, and, carrying his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
manuscript to the printing-office, took with
him also some ballads of his own composition
designed to appear in “Monk” Lewis’s collection
of “Tales of Wonder.” “With these,
especially the ‘Morlachian fragment after
Goethe,’ Ballantyne was charmed. Scott
talked of Lewis with rapture; and, after
reciting some of his stanzas, said: ‘I ought
to apologise to you for having troubled you
with anything of my own, when I had things
like this for your ear.’ ‘I felt at once,’ says
Ballantyne, ‘that his own verses were far
above what Lewis could ever do, and though,
when I said this, he dissented, yet he seemed
pleased with the warmth of my approbation.’”</p>

<p>On parting, Scott made a casual remark
that he wondered his old friend did not try
to get some work from the booksellers, “to
keep his types in play” during the intervals of
publication of the weekly <i>Mail</i>. Ballantyne
replied that such an idea had not occurred to
him, and that, moreover, he had little acquaintance
with the Edinburgh publishers; but that
his types were good, and he thought he could
produce work equal to that of any of the town
printers. “Scott, with his good-humoured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
smile, said, ‘You had better try what you
can do. You have been praising my little
ballads; suppose you print off a dozen copies
or so of as many as will make a pamphlet,
sufficient to let my Edinburgh acquaintances
judge of your skill for themselves.’ Ballantyne
assented; and exactly twelve copies of
‘William and Helen,’ ‘The Fire King,’ ‘The
Chase,’ and a few other pieces, not all Scott’s
own, were thrown off accordingly, with the
title (alluding to the long delay in the
publication of Lewis’s collection) of ‘An
Apology for Tales of Terror, 1799.’”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> A
reproduction of the title is given on the
opposite page.</p>

<p>It happened also that Hughes, Ballantyne’s
chief workman, had been trained in one of
the foremost printing-houses of the time,
and was capable of using his materials to
the best advantage; and this, joined to James
Ballantyne’s excellent taste in the selection
of type, contributed to the production of the
ballads in a style of typographical perfection
worthy of the most eminent printers
before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>In the beginning of 1894 a copy of this
very limited edition of the “Apology” was
advertised at a moderate price by a bookseller
in London. It was immediately purchased
by an Edinburgh bookseller, who had a
higher opinion of its value than his London
brother. This copy bore an inscription in
James Ballantyne’s handwriting, of which the
following is a slightly reduced facsimile—</p>

<p>Evidently, however, John Murray had given
it away some time after, as it shows the
further enrichment of the poet Campbell’s
book-plate pasted on the title-page. The
book is rare, and, till this copy was discovered,
the only one known to exist was
that at Abbotsford. It consists of seventy-six
pages and a title, and from a printer’s point
of view deserves the high praise bestowed
upon it—having meadows of margin, wide
leading, good spacing and colour.</p>

<p>In chronological order another Kelso book
falls to be noticed here, before we come to
the important time of the association of Scott
and Ballantyne with the “Minstrelsy of the
Scottish Border.” The reproduced title shows
it to be the life of Count Boruwlaski, a celebrated
dwarf, who died in 1837 at Durham,
in the ninety-ninth year of his age.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The
book, a copy of which is at Paul’s Work,
bears the date of 1801, and must of course
have been issued during the dwarf’s lifetime.
In a letter to Mr. Morritt, soon
after the publication of “Waverley,” Scott
has the following humorous reference to the
Count:—“I am heartily glad you continued
to like ‘Waverley’ to the end. The hero is
a sneaking piece of imbecility; and if he had
married Flora, she would have set him up
upon the chimney-piece, as Count Boruwlaski’s
wife used to do with him.”</p>

<p>In connection with this chapter on Kelso
work, it is gratifying to be able to print here,
besides the facsimile of the first page of
No. 1 of the <i>Kelso Mail</i>, a reduced facsimile
of a playbill for the “New Theatre” at
Kelso for Monday, November 16, 1801.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">REMOVAL TO EDINBURGH</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The “Apology” having proved thoroughly
satisfactory to Scott, he wrote to Ballantyne:
“I have been for years collecting old
Border ballads, and I think I could, with
little trouble, put together such a selection
from them as might make a neat little volume
to sell for four or five shillings. I will talk
to some of the booksellers about it when I
get to Edinburgh, and if the thing goes on,
you shall be the printer.” Ballantyne was
delighted with the proposal; and the result
of this venture changed the whole course of
his fortunes, as well as those of his friend
and patron.</p>

<p>The “neat little volume” alluded to grew
into the “Border Minstrelsy,” the editor
being fortunate enough to arouse the interest
of many scholars and antiquaries, who gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
him valuable help in the work. The first
two volumes were printed and issued by
Ballantyne in 1802, and bore the Kelso
imprint (Vol. I. 258 + 146; II. 392 + 6).
The edition consisted of eight hundred copies,
fifty of which were on large paper. It was
disposed of in the course of the year; and
the terms of publication having been that
Scott should receive half the clear profits, his
share amounted to £78, 10s. When the book
appeared, the obscure imprint of “Kelso”
was regarded with wonder by connoisseurs
of typography, who had probably never heard
of such a place, and were astonished at the
specimen of handsome printing this provincial
town had produced: it was received with
the exclamation, “What a beautiful book!”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
The editor’s name did not appear on the title-page,
but was appended to the Dedication to
the Duke of Buccleuch. A third volume of
the “Minstrelsy” followed in 1803, and was
published along with a reprint of the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
two volumes. It had Edinburgh on the
imprint.</p>

<p>In consequence of the publication of the
“Minstrelsy,” the Kelso printer soon acquired
a more than local fame, and was in general
request in the publishing world. He was
therefore induced, towards the end of 1802,
to remove to Edinburgh, and he commenced
there his long and distinguished career as a
book printer, “with two presses and a proof
one.” He adopted at first the designation of
the Border Press. This was for a short time
in premises in the neighbourhood of Holyrood,
and then again in Foulis Close, Canongate;
but in 1805 he removed to better accommodation
at Paul’s Work, where, according
to one of Scott’s letters (July 1806), he had
“established a hall, equal to that which the
genie of the lamp built for Aladdin in point of
size, but rather less superbly furnished, being
occupied by about a dozen of presses.” In
another letter to Ballantyne, Scott says, “I am
glad you have got some elbow-room at last.”</p>

<p>Paul’s Work, at North Back of Canongate,
under the shadow of the Calton Hill and
near the foot of Leith Wynd, had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
rebuilt in 1619, on the site of an earlier
religious foundation, for the reception and
entertainment of twelve poor men, under
the name of the Hospital of Our Lady,
with a chapel or altar dedicated to St. Paul;
and it must also have had some connection
with the police of the city. The accounts
of the Town Treasurer and of the Dean of
Guild are preserved in almost unbroken series
from 1552 to the present time. Many of
the entries are very quaint, and throw light
on the social conditions then prevailing in
Edinburgh. Several items illustrating the
rough justice of those days, arranged under
“discharge extraordinar,” and one referring
to Paul’s Work, may be given:—</p>

<p>Subsequent to Reformation times the building
fell into decay, but was reconstructed
and again occupied about 1619-1620 by
certain Dutch manufacturers and weavers
from Delft. It was decorated over the doorway
with the city arms and the legend,
“<span class="smcap">God · Bliss · this · Wark, 1619</span>.” We next
find it converted into a hospital for the
wounded soldiers of General Leslie’s army,
during the skirmishes which preceded his
defeat at Dunbar, and thereafter it was used
as a penal workhouse or bridewell. Portions
of the grounds and buildings were cleared
away about the middle of the eighteenth
century by James Macdowall, a merchant of
Edinburgh, who here erected a street of
dwelling-houses under his own name. At
the east end of the street there was also an
entrance to the printing-house. The whole
district—houses and everything thereabout—has
undergone a complete change, the ground
having been appropriated by the station and
goods-sheds of the North British Railway.
As a bridewell or house of correction Paul’s
Work is referred to in the “Heart of
Midlothian,” in the scene where Madge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Wildfire is examined regarding her knowledge
of Geordie Robertson and the Porteous
Riot:—</p>

<p>“‘But maybe, Madge, ye wad mind something
about it, if I was to gie ye this half-crown?’
said Sharpitlaw, taking out the
piece of money.</p>

<p>“‘That might gar me laugh, but it couldna
gar me mind.’</p>

<p>“‘But, Madge,’ continued Sharpitlaw,
‘were I to send you to the Wark-house in
Leith Wynd, and gar Jock Dalgleish lay the
tawse on your back——’</p>

<p>“‘That wad gar me greet,’ said Madge,
sobbing, ‘but it couldna gar me mind, ye
ken.’”</p>

<p>Paul’s Work was also entered from the
Canongate by the long, narrow, and steep
Coull’s Close, one of those lanes intersecting
the towering structures of the High Street
and the Canongate, so happily depicted in
one sentence of “Guy Mannering”: “Away
walked Mr. Pleydell with great activity, diving
through closes and ascending covered stairs, in
order to attain the High Street, by an access
which, compared to the common route, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
what the Straits of Magellan are to the more
open but circuitous passage round Cape Horn.”</p>

<p>James Ballantyne lived close by at No. 10
St. John Street, which was entered by an
archway from the Canongate, and led to
South Back of Canongate. At the bottom
of this street, within a couple of minutes
from Holyrood, could be seen, quite near at
hand, Arthur’s Seat, Salisbury Crags, and St.
Anthony’s Chapel and Well—a beautiful and
romantic environment of the grey old northern
capital. St. John Street, long after the
Canongate had been deserted by its courtly
occupants, continued to be the residence of
a few of the rural and city gentlefolk. In
this retired spot, only a few years previously,
lived the eccentric Lord Monboddo, who is
said to have anticipated the “evolution”
theory. Lord Monboddo’s daughter was one
of the loveliest women of her time—the
“fair Burnet” mentioned by Burns in his
“Address to Edinburgh.” A tenement at
the top of the street contained the abode of
Smollett when in Edinburgh. From its being
a private street it was a quiet locality, and in
those days was guarded by an ancient seneschal
in faded uniform, who barred all passage to
carriages and carts, except for the service of
those who lived in the street.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>One of the earliest efforts of the press in
Paul’s Work was the third volume of the
“Border Minstrelsy,” which was published in
April 1803. Scott wrote to Ballantyne: “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
have to thank you for the accuracy with which
the ‘Minstrelsy’ is thrown off. Longman
and Rees are delighted with the printing.”
The new edition of the first two volumes,
issued along with the third, consisted of
1000 copies; of Vol. III. (422 + 6) there
were 1500 printed. Five other editions
followed—the sixth being printed in 1820.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BALLANTYNE BROTHERS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The business of Paul’s Work was immediately
prosperous, and rapidly increased.
James Ballantyne was an excellent
man of business. He was also an artist in his
profession, as is shown by many of his productions,
and especially by the beautiful 1829
edition of Sir Walter Scott’s novels printed at
his press. It is to this edition that Mr. Percy
Fitzgerald makes particular reference, when
he writes: “The press of the Ballantynes,
under the inspiration of Sir Walter Scott,
issued marvels of brilliant and effective printing,
which seem to ripen with age.... There
is a calm dignity, an unobtrusive harmony, in
the large page and its proportions and tint,
that at once excites admiration.... A more
beautiful, legible, and satisfactory edition
could not be well imagined than that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the long set of the Waverley Novels, published
about ‘sixty years since.’ The size, paper,
illustrations, and extraordinary brilliance of
the type make it quite a favourite edition—indeed,
the famous tales seem to read differently
in this than in later editions of
more show and pretence.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>John Ballantyne, the next of the family to
James, came to Edinburgh soon after the removal
to Paul’s Work, and was employed as
a clerk. He is described at a later date, in
the famous “Chaldee Manuscript,” published
in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> of October 1817, as
“John, the brother of James, a man of low
stature, who giveth out merry things, and is
a lover of fables from his youth up.” He
was originally destined for a mercantile life,
but after a brief business training in London
he returned to Kelso, and remained there
till 1805, when he joined his brother James
in Edinburgh. Lockhart thus pictures the
two brothers: “James was a short, stout,
well-made man, and would have been considered
a handsome one but for grotesque
frowns, starts, and twistings of his features,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
set off by a certain mock-majesty of walk
and gesture, which he had perhaps contracted
from his usual companions, the emperors and
tyrants of the stage. His voice in talk was
grave and sonorous, and he sang well, in a
fine rich bass. John’s tone in singing was
a sharp treble; in conversation something
between a croak and a squeak.” As a storyteller
John was unrivalled, having an infinite
fund of ludicrous and characteristic anecdote,
which he set off with a humour endless in
its variety of shades. “Scott used to call the
one Aldiborontiphoscophornio; the other
Rigdumfunnidos. They both entertained
him; they both loved and revered him; and
I believe would have shed their hearts’ blood
in his service.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> “Fatsman” was another of
Scott’s playful nicknames for James Ballantyne,
as was also “Mr. Basketfill,” used by
Constable, in allusion to the well-known
printer Baskerville.</p>

<p>A favourite entertainment of Scott was the
reciting or singing by John Ballantyne of the
“Cobbler of Kelso.” On one occasion, when
Scott, Constable, and the Ballantynes were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
discussing at Abbotsford the arrangements for
the publishing of “Rob Roy,” at the end of
the business Scott turned to John, and said:—</p>

<p>“‘By-the-by, ’tis a long time, Johnny, since
we have had the “Cobbler of Kelso.”’ Mr.
Puff (a name sometimes given by Scott to
John Ballantyne) forthwith jumped up on
a mass of stone, and seating himself in the
proper attitude of one working with his awl,
began the favourite interlude, mimicking a
certain son of Crispin—at whose stall Scott and
he had often lingered when they were schoolboys—and
a blackbird, the only companion
of his cell, that used to sing to him, while
he talked and whistled to it all day long.
With this performance Scott was always
delighted: nothing could be richer than
the contrast of the bird’s wild sweet notes,
some of which he imitated with wonderful
skill, and the accompaniment of the Cobbler’s
hoarse cracked voice, uttering all manner of
endearing epithets, which Johnny multiplied
and varied in a style worthy of the Old
Women in Rabelais at the birth of Pantagruel.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>John’s private residence was called Harmony
Hall, a villa at Trinity on the Firth
of Forth, surrounded by gardens, and about
three miles distant from Paul’s Work.
Here he kept up an expensive style of
living—in all things showing a great contrast
to the sober and staid conduct of his
brother James.</p>

<p>After James Ballantyne’s removal to Edinburgh,
he continued to edit the <i>Kelso Mail</i>
for about three years, when the pressure of
the printing-office compelled him to relinquish
the editorial chair. He was succeeded
by his youngest brother, Alexander, who
conducted the paper with marked ability and
success for the next twenty years. Alexander
ultimately came to Paul’s Work, and
was made a partner in the firm in 1829.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
He was a good musician, and Sir Walter
Scott, several times in his “Journal,” tells us
how much he enjoyed his playing upon
the violin and the flageolet. Here is an
entry under May 31, 1827: “Dined at James
Ballantyne’s, and heard his brother Sandy sing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and play on the violin, beautifully as usual.
James himself sang the ‘Reel of Tullochgorum’
with hearty cheer and uplifted voice.”
And again, on July 28 of the same year,
he writes: “We heard Sandy’s violin after
dinner—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Whose touch harmonious can remove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pangs of guilty power and hopeless love.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I do not understand or care about fine music,
but there is something in his violin which
goes to the very heart.”</p>

<p>Alexander was an amiable and modest man,
never connected with Scott in any business
matters, but always his favourite in private.
During some temporary financial difficulty of
Scott in 1826, he was able to lend him £500.
He was the father of Mr. John Ballantyne,
R.S.A., a well-known artist in London,
who died in May 1897, and of the late
Mr. R. M. Ballantyne, celebrated for his
tales of travel and adventure, published by
Messrs. James Nisbet &amp; Co., which are still
popular with young people.</p>

<span class="smaller">SCOTT’S POETICAL ROMANCES</span></h2>

</div>

<p>For many years after its institution the
Ballantyne Press was in continuous action,
and the number of volumes that issued from
it can hardly be reckoned. Besides work for
publishing houses in London and Edinburgh,
all Scott’s writings were first printed there,
and the printing-house was constantly occupied
in pouring forth edition after edition
of his works. “Sir Tristrem” was published
in May 1804 by Constable, who expected so
little popularity for it that the edition consisted
of 150 copies only, which were sold
at the high price of two guineas. In due
time, however, the work had its share in the
celebrity attached to the name of its editor,
and it was through the printing of this poem
that the intimate connection of Constable
and the Ballantyne Press began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>“The Lay of the Last Minstrel” was published
in January 1805. It was a splendid
quarto volume, with “meadows of margin,”
and was greeted with unbounded applause,
both for its intrinsic merits and for its
beautiful printing.</p>

<p>It may be doubted if, in the history of
British poetry, any other work ever equalled
the demand for the “Lay.” In 1825 the
poem had reached its fourteenth edition, upwards
of 33,000 copies having been circulated;
and before 1830 11,000 copies more were
printed and disposed of. Scott entrusted the
revision of the manuscript of the poem to
his two friends—William Erskine and James
Ballantyne. Regarding the latter at this time,
Lockhart observes—and in the light of his
strictures after the financial crash the passage
may well be deemed worthy of note: “The
printer was himself a man of considerable
literary talents: his own style had the incurable
faults of pomposity and affectation,
but his eye for more venial errors in the
writings of others was quick, and though
his personal address was apt to give a stranger
the impression of insincerity, he was in reality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
an honest man, and conveyed his mind on
such matters with equal candour and delicacy
during the whole of Scott’s brilliant career.
In the vast majority of instances he found his
friend acquiesce at once in the propriety of
his suggestions; nay, there certainly were
cases, though rare, in which his advice to
alter things of much more consequence than
a word or a rhyme was frankly tendered,
and on deliberation adopted by Scott.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Mr.
Erskine was the referee whenever the poet
hesitated about taking the hints of the zealous
typographer, and his refined taste and
gentle manners rendered his critical alliance
highly valuable.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of the “Lay,”
Ballantyne found his capital inadequate to
meet the business which was flowing to his
press. He accordingly applied to his great
patron for assistance, and Scott assented, on
condition of his becoming partner with
Ballantyne, and having a third share in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
profits. This arrangement was kept strictly
private.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Attracted by Ballantyne’s superior
taste and beauty of workmanship, Scott made
it a point from the first, that whatever he
wrote or edited should be printed at the
Ballantyne Press; and his personal connection
with it stimulated his inventive genius,
directly and indirectly, to add to the rapidly
growing printing-house.</p>

<p>In April 1805 Scott wrote to Ballantyne:
“I have imagined a very superb work. What
think you of a complete edition of British
poets, ancient and modern?” This work he
proposed to edit for thirty guineas a volume.
The publishers did not quite respond to
his views in the matter, as the booksellers
refused to admit into the series certain
poets whom the editor was insisting upon,
and the scheme was abandoned. But it is
interesting to know that, if not so complete
in all respects as Scott would have
desired, a Library Edition of the British
Poets, begun in 1853, was issued from Paul’s
Work in forty-eight demy octavo volumes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
in every respect worthy of its reputation.
This series was edited by the Rev. George
Gilfillan, and published by James Nichol in
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>“An Historical Enquiry respecting the
Harp in the Highlands of Scotland” should
find its proper place here, though not in
any way connected with Scott. It has the
date 1807, and was printed at Paul’s Work
for Constable.</p>

<p>Mr. John Murray, in a letter to Constable,
bears this early and remarkable testimony to
the worth of James Ballantyne as a printer:</p>

<p>“<i>June 6, 1807.</i>—I am quite delighted with
the appearance of Mr. Gunn’s work upon the
Harp, which is a splendid and honourable
specimen of Scotch typography, which I think
cannot be surpassed in Britain. I showed the
book to Mr. Wright, a printer who stands
foremost in the second class, and he admired
and praised it greatly, and said that he thought
that Ballantyne’s <i>general</i> style of printing was
superior to that of any other printer, and that
it was a matter of nicety if Bentley and
Bulmer exceeded him even occasionally.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“Marmion” was begun in 1807 and published
in February 1808, as a splendid quarto
volume, price one guinea and a half. Of
this work 4000 copies were printed in the
year of its publication, 6000 in the year
following, and prior to 1836 as many as
50,000 in all.</p>

<p>In April 1808 William Miller of Albemarle
Street published an edition of the Works of
John Dryden in eighteen volumes. This was
edited by Scott and printed at the Ballantyne
Press. The speculation was considered a bold
one at the time, but it must have been a
success, as the entire work was reprinted
in 1821.</p>

<p>“Queenhoo Hall,” in four volumes, Carleton’s
“Memoirs of the War of the Spanish
Succession,” and the “Memoirs of Robert
Carey, Earl of Monmouth,” published in
1808, also Sadler’s “Life and State Papers,”
three volumes quarto, published in 1809,
followed by the Somers Tracts, in thirteen
volumes quarto, were all edited by Scott, and
printed by Ballantyne.</p>

<p>In May 1810 there appeared “The Lady
of the Lake,” perhaps the most popular of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
all Scott’s poems. The first edition was
in quarto, and the second in octavo; and
the successive editions, as in the case of
“Marmion,” amounted in 1836 to 50,000
copies.</p>

<p>The “Poetical Works of Miss Seward,”
in three volumes, with a Prefatory Memoir
by Scott, was published from Paul’s Work in
the autumn of 1810. This was one of the
unfortunate speculations of Scott, and the
unsaleable stock had afterwards to be taken
over by Constable at a ruinous loss.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> “It
is most curious,” says Professor Saintsbury,
“how Scott, the shrewdest and sanest of
men in the vast majority of affairs, seems to
have lost his head whenever books or lands
were concerned.”</p>

<p>In 1810 were also issued the two first
volumes of the <i>Edinburgh Annual Register</i>,
in the production of which Scott largely
aided. James Ballantyne was editor, and
other contributors included the poet Southey,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Professor Leslie, the “Man of Feeling,” and
William Erskine.</p>

<p>“The Vision of Don Roderick,” which
was Scott’s contribution to the fund in aid
of the sufferers from Massena’s campaign in
Portugal in 1810, was published in a quarto
volume in July 1811; and the romance
of “Rokeby,” another quarto, in January
1813. The edition consisted of 3250 copies,
of which only eighty remained unsold on
the second day of publication. “Rokeby”
was followed within two months by a small
volume, “The Bridal of Triermain.” The
MS. of this poem was transcribed by one
or other of the Ballantynes, in order to
guard against any indiscretion in the printing-office,
as the little work was to be issued
at first anonymously, “as a trap for Jeffrey.”
He was not deceived, however, although
other critics thought the work an imitation
of Scott.</p>

<p>The “Life and Works of Swift,” in nineteen
volumes, undertaken by Scott for Constable,
was issued from the Ballantyne Press on the
1st of July 1814. The impression consisted
of 1250 copies, and a second impression of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the same number was required in 1824. This
work was again printed at Paul’s Work in
1882-84 for Bickers &amp; Son, London.</p>

<p>How much longer Scott would have
continued to work out the vein of poetry
within him we cannot say. He was still turning
out rich ore when Byron electrified the
world with his “Childe Harold.” Scott at
once recognised that he had met his superior,
and that his supremacy as a popular poet was
seriously threatened. Many years after, only
a few months before he died, he was talking
over the events of his career with Lockhart,
his son-in-law.</p>

<p>“‘I asked him,’ said Lockhart, ‘why he
had ever relinquished poetry.’</p>

<p>“‘Because Byron <i>bet</i> me,’ Scott replied,
pronouncing the word <i>beat</i> short. ‘He <i>bet</i>
me out of the field in the description of the
strong passions, and in deep-seated knowledge
of the human heart; so I gave up poetry for
the time.’”</p>

<p>But when we look at the rich legacy that
Scott has left us in his Waverley Novels
we cannot regret this. One morning, in
searching an old desk for some fishing-flies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
he found the forgotten MS. of the first two
or three chapters of “Waverley,” which
he had written some time before. He read
over the fragment, thought it had promise
of good in it, and determined to finish the
story. This trifling circumstance led to the
unparalleled series of romances which were
read with wonder and delight when they
first appeared, and which will continue to
charm so long as our language endures.</p>

<span class="smaller">JOHN BALLANTYNE, PUBLISHER</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The business at Paul’s Work continuing
to prosper, about 1808 or 1809 a new
venture was made by John Ballantyne commencing
as publisher, with Scott as a “silent”
partner. He took the designation of “Bookseller
to the Regent.” This firm was projected
as the result of a quarrel between Scott
and Constable, regarding a political article
which appeared in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>—to
which he occasionally contributed—combined
also with the reputed incivility which
he received from Mr. Hunter, the publisher’s
partner. The capital for the new firm was
arranged, and a deed, deposited for the
purpose of secrecy in the hands of Scott,
laid the foundation of the firm of John
Ballantyne &amp; Co., publishers and booksellers,
Edinburgh. Scott appears to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
found most of the capital; and “jocund
Johnny” was installed in Hanover Street as
the avowed rival of Constable, and as publisher
in Scotland, for John Murray, of the
new <i>Quarterly Review</i>, which had been
started in opposition to the <i>Edinburgh</i>.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp53" id="illus11" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>JOHN BALLANTYNE</p>

<p>From the original painting by John Ballantyne, R.S.A.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It has often been a matter of surprise
that Scott, with his family pride, his fame,
and his money, should have adopted such
means of adding to his income. He seems
to have been ashamed in some measure of
this mercantile speculation, as all the arrangements
were kept a profound secret—Scott
being always considered the mere
patron and friend of the Ballantynes. He
evidently thought he would derive profit
from a business guided by a man of knowledge
like himself, and confounded the aspirations
of an author with the expectations
of a merchant.</p>

<p>Scott was now at the zenith of his fame
as a poet. Immense sums had been given
by other publishers for his works, still more
splendid offers were made to him for further
productions, and it would seem probable that
the idea of sharing the profits of author,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
publisher, and printer had presented itself to
his mind in this way. Accordingly, the
first work published by John Ballantyne, and
printed, of course, by James Ballantyne, was
“The Lady of the Lake,” for writing which
the sum of £3000 was placed to Scott’s
credit in the publisher’s books. After the
business was fairly begun, Scott, greatly to
the annoyance of Constable, almost wholly
withdrew himself from the premises of the
latter in the High Street, and directed his
steps to the cheerful and handsome rooms
of John Ballantyne in Hanover Street. They
formed a convenient resting-place in his
daily journeys to and from Parliament Square,
and contained a store of his favourite black-letter
volumes. No doubt, also, considering
the extreme degree to which party spirit
was carried in those days, he would find
himself pleasantly free from the band of
Edinburgh Whigs who frequented Constable’s
premises in the Old Town.</p>

<p>But the publishing firm in Hanover Street,
begun in pique, was never prosperous. Scott’s
goodness of heart led him to help on many
books which he ought to have known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
could never be successful. These included a
ponderous “History of the Culdees,” by
his friend Dr. Jamieson; a poor edition of
Beaumont and Fletcher, by Henry Weber;
three volumes of the Poems of Anna Seward,
already referred to; a bulky collection of
the Tixall Poetry and Letters; and, worse
than all, the <i>Edinburgh Annual Register</i>,
for which he himself did much work, but
which left the firm with about £1000 a year
on the wrong side of the ledger. Besides all
this, John Ballantyne proved an indifferent
and irregular book-keeper; and it was in
vain that Scott repeatedly wrote letters of
remonstrance to him, though in doing so
he frequently made the bookseller’s habits
the subject rather of his jokes than of his
indignation. John was happy-go-lucky in
his methods, and as Mr. Andrew Lang says,
“was like the proverbial spendthrift who can
never be induced to give his benevolent kinsfolk
a full schedule of his debts.” The consequence
was that the business was neglected
and allowed to drift; and in 1813, when
it was wound up, a great amount of useless
stock had been accumulated, which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
partly cleared off by forced sales to Constable
and others. Scott by this time had resumed
friendly relations with Constable, whose
partner Hunter was now out of the firm.
The printing business at Paul’s Work was
sadly hampered by these publishing transactions,
and Constable himself was seriously
injured by the burden of almost unsaleable
stock, which he had to take over as
part of the price he agreed to pay for the
copyright of forthcoming works by Scott,
and much of which he had afterwards to
sell to other booksellers at a heavy loss to
himself.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Archibald Constable was one of the most
sagacious men who have ever followed the
profession of publisher.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Though he made
no pretensions to literature, he was well
skilled in it generally, and was of most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
essential service to Scott on many occasions.
He came from Fife, served his apprenticeship
with Peter Hill, and then set up
for himself in a “small way” in a shop
forming part of the Royal Exchange buildings,
next door to Allan’s Close, High
Street. It was a mere box of a place, but
as his business increased he enlarged his premises
by opening a communication with the
tenement behind. At first he devoted his
attention to the collection of old and rare
books, and the sign above his door had in
large letters, “Scarce Books.” Shortly after
he began business the public were amused
one morning to find the preposition “of”
inserted in the sign, advertising that the
bookseller was “Scarce of Books.”</p>

<p>While struggling on, he gained the affections
of the daughter of Mr. Willison, a
well-known printer of Edinburgh. This connection
seems to have arisen through the
medium of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, which
Constable published, and which Willison
printed.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He discountenanced the match,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
but the young lady consulted her own inclinations,
and the marriage took place soon
after. The printer became reconciled, and
gave his son-in-law considerable assistance;
but the publication of the <i>Review</i> was the
chief means of Constable’s advancement, and
his little shop gradually became the rendezvous
of the learned of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>After the failure of the publishing and
bookselling company, John Ballantyne became
a literary and art auctioneer in the
Hanover Street premises. For this kind of
work he was specially qualified; and he
conducted it with marked success, particularly
in the disposal of literary property.
The auction rooms became a fashionable
lounge. A periodical which he issued in
connection with his business was called the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
<i>Sale Room</i>, written very much after the style
of the <i>Spectator</i>. It was rather a dull
concern, however, and had little success;
although one of its numbers contained a
humorous poem by Scott called “The Sultan
of Serendib, or The Search after Happiness,”
and another had an article by Lockhart
signed “Christopher Corduroy,” which first
drew Scott’s attention to that writer.</p>

<p>The first number of the <i>Sale Room</i> was
issued on Saturday, Jan. 4, 1817, and contained
the following introductory paragraph,
presumably by John Ballantyne:</p>

<p>“An architect of great skill and experience
was wont to say, that he found less difficulty
in giving the plan of a gentleman’s
seat than in devising a lodge for the termination
of his avenue. We are much
mistaken if a similar difficulty has not been
felt by most periodical essayists. The first
appearance before the public is like the
entrance of a bashful person into a ceremonious
company, and in both cases the
French proverb applies, <i>Ce n’est que le premier
pas qui coûte.</i> And how often have we seen
such a person, qualified both to entertain and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
enjoy society, suffering during a whole evening
under the too acute feeling of some
awkwardness or inadvertent solecism, which
he supposes himself to have committed on
his first entrance. But the case of the essayist
is still harder. The utmost that can be expected
from a member of fashionable society
is, that he shall present himself with the
ordinary ease and grace of men of good breeding;
and those who affect peculiarity, or
marked singularity of manners, are in our
day, as in Congreve’s, set down among the
Lord Froths and Mr. Brisks, the solemn or
lively coxcombs of society. But here the
metaphor no longer holds; for, in this department
of literature, mediocrity, however
void of affectation, or even if marked by
elegance, is insufficient to produce any impression
on the public. It is expected of us,
not only that we should be eloquent, but that
we shall be new; not only that we should be
correct, but that we shall be striking; and
that our lucubrations should promise to combine
originality with the humour of Addison,
the learning of Cumberland, and the pathos
of the Man of Feeling. Aware of the difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
not indeed of making such promises,
but of giving the public any sound reason to
think that it was in our power to keep them,
we were somewhat tempted to elude the task
of announcing our pretensions in an opening
number; and, like the worthy Irishman, who,
on finding the second month of attendance
at the fencing-school was rated at a lower
fee than that which preceded it, requested
to take the second month first, we had half
resolved to publish No. II. of <span class="smcap">The Sale
Room</span> before No. I.”</p>

<p>This opening Essay was signed C. for
Coryphæus, the name given to the presiding
genius of the contributors to the periodical.
It continued for twenty-eight numbers, the
last being issued on Saturday, July 12, 1817.
It consisted of weekly essays of varying length
of from six to eight pages, and, when the
subject matter was only sufficient to fill six
or seven, the remaining pages were left
blank.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>John Ballantyne was much in request as
musical critic on the <i>Edinburgh Weekly Journal</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
of which his brother James was editor.
He also made at least one excursion into the
field of letters. This was a novel in two
volumes called “The Widow’s Lodgings.”
It had little merit, but reached a second
edition.</p>

<p>A curious story of John’s volatile nature and
indiscreet vivacity is related in the second
volume of Mrs. Charles Mathews’ life of her
husband, the well-known humorist and actor.
At a dinner-party where Constable, Terry,
and John Ballantyne were present, he closed
a speech he had been making about some
books with the startling announcement:
“I shall soon send you Scott’s new novel!”
Mrs. Mathews goes on to say: “I shall
never forget the consternation of Messrs.
Constable and Terry, and, indeed, we were
as much embarrassed. Constable looked
daggers—and Terry used some—for, with a
stern brow and a correcting tone, he cried
out ‘John!’ adding, with a growl resembling
what is generally made to check or reprove
a mischievous dog,—‘Ah! what are you
about?’ which made us drop our eyes in pain
for the indiscreet tattler; while Wee Johnny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
looked like an impersonation of Fear, startled
at the sound himself had made. Not another
word was said; but our little good-natured
friend’s lapse was sacred with us, and the
secret was never divulged while it was important
to preserve it.”</p>

<p>John Ballantyne visited the Continent shortly
after Waterloo, and published an account of
his travels, in which the “long-bow” did
good service. Being on one occasion rebuked
by a lady for having stated as facts what were
transparent fictions, his reply to the censure
was in these few words: “Very true, madam,
what you say; but truth is a great hamperer
of genius.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>During the earlier and perhaps most interesting
years in the career of the “Great
Unknown,” John Ballantyne managed all the
business connected with the communication
of the author’s works to the public. When
Scott began “The Bride of Lammermoor,” his
amanuenses were William Laidlaw and John
Ballantyne, “of whom he preferred the latter,
when he could be at Abbotsford, on account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of the superior rapidity of his pen, and also
because John kept his pen to the paper
without interruption; and, though with many
an arch twinkle in his eyes, and now and
then an audible smack of his lips, had resolution
to work on like a well-trained clerk;
whereas good Laidlaw entered with such keen
zest into the interest of the story as it flowed
from the author’s lips, that he could not
suppress exclamations of surprise and delight—‘Gude
keep us a’!—the like o’ that!—eh
sirs!’ and so forth, which did not promote
despatch.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>In several long articles which appeared in
<i>Tait’s Magazine</i> in 1843, entitled “Random
Recollections of Scott and the Ettrick Shepherd,”
by Mr. John Morrison, a land-surveyor,
there are several notices of James and John
Ballantyne. The following is one of those
relating to John: “On a day appointed,”
says Mr. Morrison, “we all set out on a
hare-hunting expedition. Miss Scott rode
Queen Mab, a little pony; John Ballantyne
was mounted on Old Mortality, an old gaunt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
white horse. He was dressed in a green coat,
the buttons of mother-of-pearl, silver and gold—with,
if I remember well, a precious stone
in the centre, and altogether a most harlequin
and piebald figure. Sir Walter appeared to
laugh and amuse himself with his grotesque
appearance. I admired the buttons. ‘And
well you may,’ said Sir Walter. ‘These buttons,
sir, belonged to the Great Montrose,
and were cut, by our friend John, from an
old coat belonging to the Marquis, which
he purchased from an unworthy descendant of
the family, Graham of Gartmore, with many
other nick-nackets too tedious to enumerate.’
On the same day,” Mr. Morrison continues,
“at and after dinner, although he looked very
kindly on Johnny Ballantyne, Scott made
himself merry at his expense, and Ballantyne
seemed awed in his presence; although, when
addressed, he turned a bold front to any
one else. I ventured to joke him a little on
the quality of his coat, and said it was the
best at table. ‘Yes,’ said John, ‘and it belonged
to a better man.’ You will find
some difficulty in convincing Mr. Morrison
of that,’ said Sir Walter”—the latter well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
knowing that Morrison’s sentiments regarding
the character of Montrose were at
variance with his own.</p>

<p>After some years of failing health, John
Ballantyne retired to a villa which he had
built near Kelso, and here he was frequently
visited by Sir Walter. On one of these
occasions, the latter revived a long-forgotten
project of their early connection in business,
and offered his gratuitous services as editor
of a Novelists’ Library, to be printed and
published for the benefit of his friend. The
offer was eagerly embraced, and the first
volume of “Ballantyne’s Novelists’ Library”
appeared in February 1821, though the collection,
notwithstanding the Biographies and
Introductions which Scott wrote for it,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> did
not prove a fortunate speculation.</p>

<p>On the 16th of June 1821, John Ballantyne
died at Edinburgh. Until a week or two
before, Sir Walter had not entertained any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
thought that his end was so near. “I (Lockhart)
accompanied Sir Walter when one of
their last interviews took place, and John’s
deathbed was a thing not to be forgotten.
We sat by him for perhaps an hour, and I
think half that space was occupied with his
predictions of a speedy end, and details of his
last will, which he had just been executing,
and which lay on his coverlid; the other half
being given, five minutes or so at a time, to
questions and remarks, which intimated that
the hope of life was still flickering before
him—nay, that his interest in all its concerns
remained eager. The proof-sheets of a
volume of his Novelists’ Library lay also by
his pillow; and he passed from them to his
will, and then back to them, as by jerks and
starts the unwonted veil of gloom closed upon
his imagination, or was withdrawn again....
Scott was visibly and profoundly shaken by
this scene and sequel. As we stood together
a few days afterwards, while they were
smoothing the turf over John’s remains in
the Canongate Churchyard, the heavens,
which had been dark and slaty, cleared up
suddenly, and the midsummer sun shone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
forth in his strength. Scott, ever awake to
the skyey influences, cast his eye along the
overhanging line of the Calton Hill, with
its gleaming walls and towers, and then
turning to the grave again, ‘I feel,’ he
whispered in my ear, ‘I feel as if there
would be less sunshine for me from this
day forth.’</p>

<p>“As we walked homewards, Scott told me,
among other favourable traits of his friend,
one little story which I must not omit. He
remarked one day to a poor student of
divinity attending his auction, that he looked
as if he were in bad health. The young
man assented with a sigh. ‘Come,’ said
Ballantyne, ‘I think I ken the secret of a
sort of draft that would relieve you—particularly,’—he
added, handing him a cheque
for £5 or £10—‘particularly, my dear, if
taken upon an empty stomach.’”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>In the “Noctes Ambrosianæ” (vol. iii. pp.
93-95), there is the following tribute to the
memory of John Ballantyne:—</p>

<p><i>Shepherd.</i> Johnny Ballantyne!</p>

<p><i>North.</i> Methinks I see him—his slight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
slender figure, restless with a spirit that knew
no rest—his face so suddenly changeful in its
expression from what a stranger might have
thought habitual gravity, into what his friends
knew to be native there—glee irrepressible
and irresistible—the very madness of mirth,
James, in which the fine ether of animal
spirits seemed to respire the breath of genius,
and to shed through the room, or the open
air, a contagion of cheerfulness, against which
no heart was proof, however sullen, and no
features could stand, however grim; but still
all the company, Canters and Covenanters
inclusive, relaxed and thawed into murmurs
of merriment, even as the strong spring sunshine
sends a-singing the bleak frozen moor-streams
till all the wilderness is alive with
music.</p>

<p><i>Shepherd.</i> He was indeed a canty cratur—a
delichtfu’ companion.</p>

<p><i>North.</i> I hear his voice this moment within
my imagination, as distinct as if it were
speaking. ’Twas exceedingly pleasant....</p>

<p><i>Shepherd.</i> What’n a lauch!</p>

<p><i>North.</i> Soul-and-heart-felt!</p>

<p><i>Shepherd.</i> Mony a strange story fell down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
stane-dead when his tongue grew mute.
Thousands o’ curious, na, unaccountable anecdotes,
ceased to be the day his een were
closed, for he telt them, sir, as ye ken, wi’ his
een mair than his lips; and his verra hauns
spak, when he snapped his forefinger and his
thoom, or wi’ the haill five spread out—and
he had what I ca’ an elegant haun o’ fine
fingers, as maist wutty men hae—manually
illustrated his subjeck, till the words gaed aff,
murmuring like bees frae the tips; and then
Johnny was quate again for a minute or sae,
till some ither freak o’ a fancy came athwart
his genie, and instantly loupt intil look, lauch,
or speech—or rather a’ the three thegither
in ane, while Sir Walter himsel keckled on
his chair, and leanin’ wi’ thae extraordinar
chowks o’ his, that aften seem to me amaist
as expressive as his pile o’ forehead, hoo would
he fix the grey illumination o’ his een on his
freen Johnny, and ca’ him by that familiar
name; and by the sympathy o’ that maist
capawcious o’ a’ souls, set him clean mad—richt-doun
wudd a’thegither—till really,
sir, he got untholeably divertin’; and folk
compleened o’ pains in their sides, and sat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
wi’ the tears rinnin’ doun their cheeks,
praying him for gudeness to haud his tongue,
for that gin he didna, somebody or ither
would be fa’in doun in a fit, and be carried
out dead.</p>

<p>“Waverley,” the first of a series
of novels unsurpassed for power,
picturesqueness, and variety, as well as healthy
sentiment and morality, was published anonymously
in three volumes on the 7th July
1814. This edition of 1000 copies was sold
within five weeks. A second of 2000 followed
immediately, and a third and fourth,
each of 1000, appeared in October and November
of the same year. The mystery in which
the author had chosen to shroud himself,
and the high literary character of the work,
had meanwhile given rise to an intensity of
interest and speculation hitherto unparalleled
in the history of literature. Scott was pressed
by his few friends who were in the secret to
own the authorship, and take to himself the
laurels which were being freely handed about.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
He steadfastly refused, and wrote the following
humorous reply to one of John Ballantyne’s
expostulations:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“No, John, I will not own the book—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I won’t, you <i>Picaroon</i>!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When next I try St. Grubby’s brook,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The A. of Wa—— shall bait the hook,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And flat-fish bite as soon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if before them they had got</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The worn-out <i>wriggler</i>—Walter Scott.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>About 40,000 copies of “Waverley” were
sold previous to the publication of the first
uniform edition of the novels, with introductions
and notes by the author, in
1829.</p>

<p>“The Lord of the Isles,” which Scott
alludes to as closing his poetic labours upon
an extended scale, appeared on the 18th
January 1815. This poem, the title of which
was originally intended to be “The Nameless
Glen,” was received with perhaps less favour
than former ones. Regarding “The Lord of
the Isles,” James Ballantyne had a somewhat
delicate task to perform, of which he left the
following account: “‘Well, James,’ said Scott
to his printer, ‘I have given you a week;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
what are people saying about “The Lord of
the Isles”?’ I hesitated a little, after the
fashion of Gil Blas, but he speedily brought
the matter to a point. ‘Come,’ he said,
‘speak out, my good fellow; what has put
it into your head to be on so much ceremony
<i>with me</i> all of a sudden? But I see how it
is, the result is given in one word—Disappointment!’
My silence admitted his inference
to the fullest extent. His countenance
certainly did look rather blank for a few
seconds; in truth, he had been wholly unprepared
for the event; for it is a singular fact
that, before the public, or rather the booksellers,
gave their decision, he no more knew
whether he had written well or ill, than
whether a die thrown out of a box was to
turn up a ‘size’ or an ace. However, he
instantly resumed his spirits, and expressed
his wonder rather that his poetic popularity
should have lasted so long, than that it should
now at last have given way. At length he
said, with perfect cheerfulness: ‘Well, well,
James, so be it;—but, you know, we must
not droop, for we can’t afford to give over.
Since one line has failed, we must just stick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
to something else,’ and so he dismissed me,
and resumed his novel.”</p>

<p>The interest taken in the growing success
of the mysterious “Waverley” was greatly
heightened, and the curious public were
somewhat bewildered, by the simultaneous
announcement with the publication of “The
Lord of the Isles” of another prose work of
fiction by the A. of W——, nearly ready for
issue. This work, “Guy Mannering”—the
result of six weeks’ labour of the Christmas
recess—appeared on the 24th February 1815,
and was pronounced by universal consent to
be worthy of its author. The first edition,
consisting of 2000 copies, was sold out the
day after publication, and within three months
second and third editions, amounting to 5000
copies, were also disposed of; and before 1837
the total sale reckoned up to 50,000.</p>

<p>The poem of “The Field of Waterloo”
was issued in October 1815, the profits of
the first edition being Scott’s contribution to
the fund raised for the widows and orphans
of the soldiers slain in the battle. Lockhart’s
“Life” (v. 99-104) contains a list, much too
lengthy to reproduce here, of the Ballantynes’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
suggestions on this poem, with Scott’s objections
and admissions. One or two instances
of those by James may, however, be given:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Stanza I.—‘Fair Brussels, thou art far behind.’</p>

<p><i>James Ballantyne.</i>—I do not like this line. It is tame,
and the phrase <i>far behind</i> has, to my feeling, some associated
vulgarity.</p>

<p><i>Scott.</i>—Stet.</p>

<p>Stanza VIII.—‘Nor ceased the <i>intermitted</i> shot.’</p>

<p><i>James.</i>—Mr. Erskine contends that <i>intermitted</i> is
redundant.</p>

<p><i>Scott.</i>—‘Nor ceased the <i>storm of shell and shot</i>.’</p>

<p>Stanza XII.—‘Nor was one forward footstep <i>stopped</i>.’</p>

<p><i>James.</i>—This staggering word was intended, I presume,
but I don’t like it.</p>

<p><i>Scott.</i>—Granted. Read <i>staid</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Stanza XV.—‘Wrung forth by pride, <i>regret</i>, and
shame.’</p>

<p><i>James.</i>—I have ventured to submit to your choice—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Wrung forth by pride, <i>and rage</i>, and shame.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Regret</i> appearing a faint epithet amidst such a combination
of bitter feelings.</p>

<p><i>Scott.</i>—Granted.</p>

<p>Stanza XXI.—‘Through his friend’s heart to <i>wound</i>
his own.’</p>

<p><i>James.</i>—Quære—<i>Pierce</i>, or rather <i>stab</i>—<i>wound</i> is faint.</p>

<p><i>Scott.</i>—<i>Pierce.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>Constable (iii. 84) says regarding this
revision: “No better evidence of Scott’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
constitutional good nature could be given than
will be found in the strictures on this poem
by James and John Ballantyne when it was
passing through the press, and the genial
manner in which he either agrees or declines
to give effect to them.” And Mr. Andrew
Lang in his “Life of Scott”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> testifies: “The
emendations made by John Ballantyne on
the proof-sheets of this effort show considerable
intelligence and taste, and in several
cases were approved of and accepted by the
author, though he once said that he was
‘The Black Brunswicker of literature, who
neither took nor gave criticism.’”</p>

<p>“Paul’s Letters to his Kinsfolk,” a series
of letters describing a visit to Belgium
and the field of Waterloo, appeared in
January 1816 as an octavo volume,—the first
edition consisting of 6000 copies, followed
in the course of a few years by second and
third editions of 3000. The work, avowedly
by Scott, was hailed as a specimen of his
prose writing, suggesting a comparison with
that of the “Great Unknown.” The last
of the “copy” of these letters reached James<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Ballantyne on the 26th December 1815, and
contained a few lines of Scott’s playful doggerel,
having reference also to his next novel:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“<span class="smcap">Dear James</span>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’m done, thank God, with the long yarns</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of the most prosy of Apostles—Paul;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now advance, sweet Heathen of Monkbarns,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Step out, old quiz, as fast as I can scrawl.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The Antiquary,” begun towards the close
of 1815, was issued in May 1816. Six days
sufficed to exhaust the edition, which consisted
of as many thousand copies. This
work attained a popularity not inferior to
that of its predecessors. It was while correcting
the proof-sheets of this novel that the
author took to fabricating mottoes for the
chapter headings. One day John Ballantyne,
who was sitting beside him, was asked to
hunt for a certain passage in Beaumont and
Fletcher, and as he did not succeed, “Hang
it, Johnnie,” said Scott, “I believe I can
make a motto sooner than you will find
one.” From that time he had recourse to
his own invention, attributing the mottoes
to “old ballad” or “old play.”</p>

<p>The same year, October 1816, saw the publication<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
of another volume of the <i>Edinburgh
Annual Register</i>, containing an historical sketch
of the year 1814 by Scott, sufficient of itself
to form the contents of a large volume.</p>

<p>On the 1st of December 1816 the First
Series of the “Tales of My Landlord,” containing
“Old Mortality” and “The Black
Dwarf,” appeared, but minus the talismanic
words “By the Author of ‘Waverley.’”
This work, published by John Murray, was
received with undiminished favour; and all
doubt as to whether these “Tales” proceeded
from the pen of the author of “Waverley”
was set at rest in a week, and within two
months three editions of 2000 each were
printed. Murray and Blackwood had still
in stock a large number of copies of this
book, when John Ballantyne advertised a
new edition, in disregard of arrangements
with the publishers. He was expostulated
with, and threatened with an action for
damages; but as this would have revealed
the author, who was still the “Great Unknown,”
the matter was compromised and
the books were transferred to Constable.</p>

<p>“Harold the Dauntless, by the Author of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
‘Triermain,’” was published in January 1817.
The “History of the Year 1815,” by Scott,
appeared in the <i>Register</i>, published in
August 1817; and time was also found to
prepare an Introduction to a richly illustrated
quarto edition of the “Border Antiquities,”
which was issued a month later.</p>

<p>“Rob Roy,” projected in May and arranged
for by Constable, was issued in
December 1817. It started with a first
edition of 10,000, and within a fortnight a
second of 3000 more was required. While
the manuscript of the novels was usually
transcribed by the Ballantynes, this one was
copied by George Stillie, a clerk at Paul’s
Work. He died a few days after James
Ballantyne in 1833. His brother James was
in the service of John Ballantyne in Hanover
Street, and, on the failure of that business, was
employed at Paul’s Work. James Stillie was
afterwards a bookseller in Edinburgh for many
years, and his shop in George Street was the
resort of book-collectors from all parts of the
kingdom—including Mr. Gladstone when he
came to Edinburgh. He lived to a great
age, and died in August 1893.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>Scott had scarcely completed “Rob Roy”
when he projected the Second Series of the
“Tales of My Landlord,” in which was comprised
“The Heart of Midlothian,” to be
ready by the 4th June 1818, at which date
it duly appeared. The Third Series of the
“Tales” came out on the 10th June 1819.
This Series included “The Bride of Lammermoor”
and the “Legend of Montrose.” Scott
had suffered severely in health for some time
previous, and the work was received with
a sad presentiment that it might be the
last from its author’s pen; but, except in a
few errors, the result of his inability to correct
the proof-sheets, no one could perceive
the slightest indication of his illness.</p>

<p>On the 18th December 1819 the romance
of “Ivanhoe” appeared. The work was
hailed in England “with a more clamorous
delight than any of the <i>Scotch novels</i> had been.”
It came out in three vols., post 8vo, price
30s., and in this original form 12,000 copies
were sold. “Mr. Ballantyne the printer, who
is a good judge, speaks very highly of this
romance” (“Scott’s Letters,” ii. 63).</p>

<p>“The Monastery” was published by Longman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
&amp; Co. in March 1820. It appeared
in three vols. 12mo, like the earlier works of
the Series. Its popularity was enhanced by
“The Abbot,” which followed in September,
published by the same firm, in conjunction
with Constable.</p>

<p>“Kenilworth” appeared in January 1821,
three vols. post 8vo, similar to “Ivanhoe,”
and this form was adhered to in all the subsequent
volumes of the Series. “Kenilworth”
was one of the most successful of all at the
time of publication, and will probably continue
to hold a place in the highest rank of
prose fiction.</p>

<p>The splendid romance of “The Pirate” was
published in the beginning of December
1821; and “The Fortunes of Nigel” on the
30th May 1822, followed in June by the
dramatic sketch of “Halidon Hill.” For
the copyright of the last Constable paid
Scott the sum of £1000. “Nigel” took its
place amongst the first of Scott’s romances,
and on publication was eagerly sought after.
According to a letter of Constable, “so
keenly were the people devouring my friend
<i>Jingling Geordie</i>” (George Heriot, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
leading characters in the story), “that I actually
saw them reading it in the streets” (of
London) “as they passed along.”</p>

<p>At this time the profits of the author’s
works were estimated at from £10,000 to
£15,000 a year, and Ballantyne’s presses
were taxed to their utmost. In addition to
the ordinary work of the office, he had
also in hand for Constable a reprint of
Scott’s Poetical Works, miniature edition, ten
vols., 5000 copies; Novels and Tales, twelve
vols., miniature edition, 5000 copies; Historical
Romances, six vols., 5000 copies;
Poetry from “Waverley,” &amp;c., one vol., 5000
copies—equal to 145,000 volumes; to which
from thirty to forty thousand may be added
as the result of Scott’s daily industry within
the space of twelve months.</p>

<p>“Peveril of the Peak” appeared in January
1823. The work was at first rather coldly
received, but was finally pronounced not unworthy
of Scott’s pen. “Quentin Durward”
followed in June, and attained great popularity.
In this novel he had, for the first time,
ventured on foreign ground, and the French
public were seized with a frenzy of delight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
to find that Louis XI. and Charles the Bold
had started into life again under the wand
of the Northern Magician. The excitement
in Paris equalled that of Edinburgh under
the influence of the first appearance of
“Waverley,” or that of London under the
spell of “Ivanhoe.”</p>

<p>Constable during this year completed the
purchase from Scott of the copyright of the
Waverley Novels, for which he had paid up
to this time the sum of £22,000, in addition
to Scott’s half-share of profits of the early
editions. The novel of “St. Ronan’s Well”
was published in December 1823.</p>

<p>Immediately on the conclusion of “St.
Ronan’s Well,” Sir Walter began “Redgauntlet,”
which was published in June 1824. It
was originally called “Herries,” until Constable
and James Ballantyne persuaded the
author to choose the more striking name.
This fascinating work contains more of the
author’s personal experiences than any of his
previous fictions, or even than all of them
put together,—not to mention the incomparable
legend of “Wandering Willie’s Tale.”
It was the only novel Scott produced during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
this year, but he was abundantly occupied
in preparing for press the second edition of
his voluminous Swift, the additions and corrections
to which were numerous and careful.
Towards the end of the year the “Tales of
the Crusaders” were begun, and were issued
in June 1825. “The Betrothed” found little
favour with James Ballantyne, and his remonstrance
weighed so much with the author
that he resolved to cancel it altogether.
Meanwhile, spurred by disappointment, he
began another story, “The Talisman.” The
brightness of this new tale dazzled the eyes
of the public; and the burst of favour
which attended the brilliant procession of
Saladin and Cœur-de-Lion considerably
modified Scott’s literary plans, and “The
Betrothed” was issued under its wing.</p>

<p>“The Letters of Malachi Malagrowther,”
written against the Government proposal to
interfere with the Scottish banking system,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
appeared on the 1st of March 1826; and on
the day following Scott writes: “The First
Epistle of Malachi already out of print.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
These Letters—of which there were three—first
appeared in Ballantyne’s <i>Edinburgh Weekly
Journal</i>, and were afterwards collected into a
pamphlet and published by Blackwood. This
ran into numerous editions, the Scottish banks
taking hundreds of copies for gratuitous
circulation. It was often referred to in subsequent
discussions in Parliament, and is
believed to have had considerable influence
in causing the abandonment of the measure.
A fourth Letter was written in December
1830, but, in deference to the opinions of
James Ballantyne and Cadell the publisher,
the essay, though put in type, was never
issued, and manuscript and proof were finally
consigned to the flames.</p>

<p>“Woodstock,” written during a period of
great commercial distress, was finished in April
and issued in June 1826. This most successful
novel realised the large sum of £8228.</p>

<p>The “Life of Bonaparte,” which had been
in progress during two years of deep affliction,
was published in June 1827. Its contents
are equal to thirteen volumes of the Waverley
Novels in their original form. The first
and second editions produced the enormous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
sum of £18,000. Regarding the “Life of
Bonaparte” there is a characteristic entry in
Scott’s “Journal,” dated September 6, 1826,
referring to some suggestions of James
Ballantyne:—</p>

<p>“I had a letter from Jem Ballantyne—plague
on him!—full of remonstrance, deep
and solemn, upon the carelessness of ‘Bonaparte.’
<i>The rogue is right, too.</i> But as to
correcting my style to the ‘Jemmy jemmy
linkum feedle’ tune of what is called fine
writing, I’ll be d——d if I do.”</p>

<p>Scott also at this time superintended the
first collection of his Prose Miscellanies,
published in six vols. 8vo, several articles
being remodelled and extended to adapt them
for a more permanent existence than had
been originally thought of.</p>

<p>The First Series of “Chronicles of the
Canongate” was published in November 1827,
but the work did not meet with the favour
awarded to his previous writings, and Sir
Walter was much discouraged. Yet the
wondrous power and fertility of his genius
remained undiminished, and the First Series
of “Tales of a Grandfather” followed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
December. It met with a heartier reception
than any other of his works since
“Ivanhoe,” and years only add to its popularity.
The “Chronicles of the Canongate,”
Second Series, three vols. 8vo, and “Tales
of a Grandfather,” Second Series, three vols.
18mo, were both published in 1828. In this
year was also published “Religious Discourses
by a Layman,” being signed by “W.S.”
These were originally written by Sir Walter
Scott to aid a young candidate for the
ministry in the Kirk of Scotland.</p>

<p>“The Fair Maid of Perth” was finished
in March, and published in April of the same
year. “Anne of Geierstein” appeared about
the middle of May 1829. The Third Series
of “Tales of a Grandfather” appeared this
year; and Scott’s remaining labours were:
In 1829—“History of Scotland,” Vol. I.;
Waverley Novels, Vols I. to VIII., with new
Introductions and Notes (monthly). In 1830—“Doom
of Devorgoil” and “Auchindrane”;
“Essays on Ballad Poetry”; “Letters
on Demonology and Witchcraft”; “Tales of
a Grandfather,” Fourth Series; “History of
Scotland,” Vol. II. In 1831—“Count Robert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
of Paris” and “Tales of My Landlord,”
Fourth Series.</p>

<p>When the publishing of the Waverley
Novels passed into the hands of Cadell, about
1825-26, and the issue of the author’s own
edition commenced in 1829—this being playfully
distinguished by Scott himself as “the
<i>Magnum</i>”—the sale again proved large. The
legends, family traditions, and historical facts
which formed the groundwork of the novels
were now added by the author himself, and
attracted anew the public attention. Cadell
began this edition with 7000, raised the
estimate to 10,000, and then to 12,000,
while the ultimate circulation rose to about
35,000 a month—a figure then unprecedented.
This, it should be remembered, was probably
done on the hand-press, as the printing-machine
was making slow headway, and
must have greatly taxed the resources of
the printing-house. The publication arrangements
of the novels and other works mentioned
in this chapter were variously and sometimes
jointly made by Constable, Blackwood, Longman,
Murray, John Ballantyne, and latterly
by Cadell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>Since that time many editions of Scott’s
Poetical and Prose Works have passed through
the Ballantyne Press. One of the most important
is the Border Edition of the Waverley
Novels in forty-eight volumes, edited with
additional Introductions and Notes by Mr.
Andrew Lang, illustrated with many etchings,
and published by John C. Nimmo, London.
This edition has now passed into the hands
of Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Co.</p>

</div>

<p>The Waverley Novels long continued to
be spoken of as the works of the
“Great Unknown,”—the titles of the successive
novels simply showing that they were
by the “Author of ‘Waverley.’” The designation
was first conferred upon Scott by James
Ballantyne. It was never publicly discarded
until the Theatrical Fund dinner on February
23, 1827, when the author, in reply to
the toast of his health, in which the secret
was divulged,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> uttered these memorable
words: “I certainly did not think, in coming
here to-day, that I should have the task
of acknowledging, before three hundred
gentlemen, a secret which, considering it was
communicated to more than twenty people,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
has been remarkably well kept.... I am
willing, however, to plead <i>guilty</i>—nor shall I
detain the Court by a long explanation why
my confession has been so long deferred. Perhaps
caprice might have a considerable share
in the matter. I have now to say, however,
that the merits of these works, if they had
any, and their faults, are all imputable to
myself.”</p>

<p><i>By permission of</i> <span class="smcap">Charles E. S. Chambers</span>, Esq.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>During much of this period of secrecy
James Ballantyne had the almost exclusive
task of corresponding with the author, who
had thus the advantage not only of his professional
talents, but also of his critical abilities;
and it is admitted that the works of
his friend and patron are indebted to him
for many judicious emendations, as Scott’s
inattention to not unimportant details rendered
such assistance necessary. In early life Scott
wrote a legible hand, though being—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A clerk foredoomed his father’s soul to cross,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who pens a stanza when he should engross,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">his verses displayed more character than his
chirography. In regard to this Mr. Andrew
Lang, in his Introduction to the Border<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
Edition of “Waverley,” says: “About Shakespeare
it was said that he ‘never blotted a
line.’ The observation is almost literally true
about Sir Walter. The pages of his manuscript
novels show scarcely a retouch or
erasure, whether in the ‘Waverley’ fragment
of 1805 or the unpublished ‘Siege of Malta’
of 1832. The handwriting becomes closer
and smaller; from thirty-eight lines to the
page in ‘Waverley,’ he advances to between
fifty and sixty in ‘Ivanhoe.’ The
few alterations are usually additions.”</p>

<p>Professor Saintsbury observes: “Scott was
always a rapid worker, but it was only now,
under the combined stimulus of the new-found
gift, the desire for more land and a
statelier Abbotsford, and the pressure of the
affairs of Ballantyne &amp; Co., that he began to
work at the portentous rate which, though
I do not believe that it at all injured the
quality of his production, pretty certainly endangered
his health.” The only systematic
check on Scott’s rapid production was that
introduced by James Ballantyne, who read his
proofs, and frequently saved him from oversights
and inconsistencies. In this connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the following entry is to be found in Scott’s
“Journal,” June 22, 1828—no doubt when he
was in failing health:—“Had a note from
Ballantyne complaining of my manuscript,
and requesting me to read it over. I would
give £1000 if I could; but it would take
me longer to read than to write. I cannot
trace my <i>pieds de mouche</i> but with great
labour and trouble; so e’en take your own
share of the burden, my old friend; and,
since I cannot read, be thankful I can write.”</p>

<p>When the manuscript or “copy” was transcribed
the original was preserved with great
care. As the novels were frequently begun
to be set in type before they were fully
written, only a few compositors were required
to keep pace with author and amanuensis;
and it is remarkable that there was not an
instance of treachery during all the years
these precautions were resorted to, although
various amanuenses were employed at different
times. Double proof-sheets were regularly
printed. One was forwarded to the
author by Ballantyne, and the alterations which
it received from Scott were copied by him
upon the other proof-sheet for the use of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
printers; so that even the corrected proofs
of the author were never seen in the printing-office.
In this way the curiosity of such
eager inquirers as made minute investigations
was baulked, though the authorship was an
“open secret” with many of the compositors.</p>

<p>The following Notice, however, shows that
sheets of the work in hand must have been
finding their way out of the printing-office:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“NOTICE</p>

<p>“Having reason to believe that the Workmen
in the <span class="smcap">Printing Office at Paul’s Work</span> are

Author of ‘Waverley,’—Notice is hereby
given, that the most effectual steps are taken
to detect those offending in this manner; and

executed on those proved guilty of so flagrant
an offence.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">255 High Street</span>, <i>20th April 1822</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is an unwritten tradition that such
knowledge of anonymous authorship is never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
carried outside the printing-house, although
the manuscript might be well enough known
to the compositors; and there have been instances
in which attempts to pry into secrets
of this nature have been made. Though
suspected and sometimes taxed with the
authorship of the novels, before the fact was
made publicly known, Scott’s invariable reply
to those who asked his reason for concealment
was that it was his humour. The author,
in his works of fiction, displayed wonderful
skill and resource, and no one understood
better how to turn the public favour to a
thrifty advantage. He knew the value of the
incognito after the publication of “Waverley,”
and made excellent use of it, while his denials
were intended rather as rebuffs to persons
asking questions they had no right to ask
than as conveying a false impression. He
may also have wished to escape the annoyance
of having productions known to be his
made the topic of discussion in his presence.</p>

<p>So well was the secret kept, however, that
even William Blackwood and John Murray
did not know who the author was, though
they had their surmises, as appears from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
following under the date of February 1816:
“Mr. Blackwood, like Mr. Murray, was
anxious to have a share in the business of
publishing the works of Walter Scott, especially
the novels teeming from the press by ‘The
Author of “Waverley.”’ Although Constable
and the Ballantynes were necessarily admitted
to the knowledge of their authorship, to the
world at large they were anonymous, and the
author still remained unknown. Mr. Murray
had, indeed, pointed out to Mr. Canning that
‘Waverley’ was by Walter Scott; but Scott
himself trailed so many red herrings across
the path, that publishers as well as the public
were thrown off the scent, and both Blackwood
and Murray continued to be at fault
with respect to the authorship of the Waverley
Novels.” Again, a few months after:
“The controversy still continued as to the
authorship. ‘For these six months past,’
wrote Blackwood (6th June 1816), ‘there
have been various rumours with regard to
Greenfield being the author, but I never paid
much attention to it; the thing appeared
to me so very improbable.... But from
what I have heard lately, I now begin to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
think that Greenfield may probably be the
author.’ On the other hand, Mr. Mackenzie
called upon Blackwood, and informed him
that ‘he was now convinced that Thomas
Scott, Walter’s brother in Canada, writes all
the novels.’ The secret, however, was kept
for many years longer.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In Sinclair’s “Old Times and Distant
Places,” a characteristic story is related by
Mr. Guthrie Wright, one of Scott’s friends:
“I called one day,” he says, “at the Edinburgh
Post Office, and began to read in the
lobby a letter from Lady Abercorn, in which
she gave an answer to some arguments I
had stated to her in proof that Sir Walter
was the author of ‘Waverley’; while thus
employed I stumbled on Sir Walter himself.
He immediately inquired about whom I was
reading so busily. ‘About <i>you</i>,’ I replied,
and put the letter into his hands. I soon
observed him blush as red as scarlet, and
recollected that Lady Abercorn in her letter
had said, ‘I am quite sure you are wrong, for
Sir Walter Scott declared to me <i>upon his honour</i>
that he was not the author of “Waverley.”’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
On reading this, Sir Walter exclaimed, ‘I am
sure I never said so, I never pledged my
honour—she is quite mistaken.’ Then, perceiving
that he had thus betrayed himself, he
stammered out some unintelligible sentence,
and then continued: ‘Well, Mr. Wright, it
is a very curious question, who can be the
author of these novels. Suppose we take
a walk round the Calton Hill, and lay our
heads together to find him out.’ We proceeded
arm-in-arm, and I said, ‘I think that
we can soon so completely hedge in the
author that he cannot escape us.’ ‘Well,
then,’ said Sir Walter, ‘how would you hedge
him in?’ I replied, ‘You will agree with
me that the author of “Waverley,” whoever
he may be, must be a lawyer?’ ‘True, it is
evident he must be a lawyer.’ ‘You will also
admit that he must be an antiquary?’ ‘No
doubt he must be an antiquary.’ ‘He must
also be of Jacobite connections?’ ‘Certainly,
he must have Jacobite propensities.’ ‘He
must also have a strong turn for poetry?’
‘Yes, he must be something of a poet.’ I
next assigned some reasons why he must be
rather more than forty years of age, and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
added, ‘Now, among our friends in the Parliament
House, let us consider how many there
are who, besides being lawyers, poets, antiquaries,
and of Jacobite connections, are rather
more than forty years of age.’ ‘Well,’ says
Sir Walter, ‘what do you think of Cranstoun?’
I gave reasons for setting aside Lord
Cranstoun’s pretensions, adverting particularly
to his want of humour; and then Sir
Walter, seeing that he himself must inevitably
come next, unloosed his arm and said,
‘Mr. Wright, the author of “Waverley,”
whoever he may be, gets people to buy
his books without a name; and he would
be a greater fool than I think he is, were he
to give a name. Good morning.’”</p>

<p>So decided was Scott on this matter of
anonymity that the legal form, dated 1818,
conveying to Messrs. Constable &amp; Co. the
existing copyrights, contained a clause by
which they were bound, under a penalty of
£2000, never to divulge the author’s name
during his lifetime; and a similar clause
appeared in another legal instrument in 1821.
There was no necessity for the manuscripts
being re-written by James Ballantyne and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
others, unless it were to prevent the “Great
Unknown” from being identified. The handwriting
of Scott was eminently readable and
easily followed, and so was that of his various
amanuenses; and this for the compositor was
a great boon.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Subsequent to transcription and publication,
the “Waverley” manuscripts were either sent
back to Scott himself or placed in charge
of his intimate friend, William Erskine (Lord
Kinnedder). After the latter’s death the
manuscripts and correspondence were carefully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
sealed up and returned by Erskine’s
trustees to Sir Walter, and these, along with
others, were afterwards widely dispersed by
private arrangement or at public sales.</p>

<p>In 1823, four years prior to the public
acknowledgment of the authorship of the
Waverley Novels, Scott presented a number
of his manuscripts to Constable. This gift
was made on the morning after the first
Bannatyne Club dinner, when the publisher
received a letter from Scott begging his “acceptance
of a parcel of MSS., which I know
your partialities will give more value to than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
they deserve; and only annex the condition
that they shall be scrupulously concealed
during the author’s life.” Among those sent
were manuscripts which had been in Lord
Kinnedder’s possession, and also a few more
from Abbotsford; but, before this, Constable
had already in his possession the manuscripts of
several of Sir Walter’s poems,—of “Rokeby,”
“Marmion,” “Don Roderick,” “Waterloo,”
“Lord of the Isles”; and also of the “Life
of Swift.” That of the “Lay” was unfortunately
not preserved, as it had not been
thought important, till after the publication
of “Marmion,” that such should be kept;
but John Ballantyne long possessed the manuscript
of “The Lady of the Lake,” and it was
to him that Constable was indebted for
“Rokeby.” The poet Hogg, referring to the
manuscript of “Marmion,” says it was “a
great curiosity, being all written off-hand
on post-letters from Ashestiel, Mainsforth,
Rokeby and London.”</p>

<p>On the death of Constable in 1827 the
various manuscripts of Scott’s works in his
possession were claimed by the creditors on
Sir Walter’s estate and also by Sir Walter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
himself. The matter having been referred
to arbitration, it was decided that the condition
originally attached was no longer of
any avail, and the author of the Waverley
Novels then said, “If they are not mine,
I do not wish to interfere in the matter in
the slightest degree.” The trustees accordingly
sent the manuscripts to Mr. Evans, at
that time the principal literary auctioneer
in London, and they were put up for sale
in August 1831. “The sale-rooms of Mr.
Evans,” says a literary journal of the day,
“were crowded by the curious to witness
the sale of the original manuscripts of the
Waverley Novels.” They did not realise anything
like the prices expected. The whole
amount obtained for the manuscripts of the
Constable lot was only £317, and it was
believed that rumours of the large sums
such manuscripts would be likely to fetch had
deterred many prospective purchasers from
attending the sale. For instance, it may be
mentioned that the manuscript of “Waverley”
was bought by Mr. Wilks, M.P., for £18,
and re-sold a few days after to Mr. Hall for
£42. The latter subsequently gave a small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
portion of it to Cadell, and this portion
afterwards found its way to Abbotsford. The
main part of “Waverley,” however, was presented,
in September 1850, by Mr. Hall to
the Advocates’ Library at Edinburgh, where
it may now be seen.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The manuscript of
“Rob Roy” was another purchase of Mr.
Wilks, for £50, and at his death it was
bought by Cadell for £82, the latter afterwards
presenting it to Lockhart.</p>

<p>Shortly after their publication many of the
Waverley Novels were pirated in Germany.
A copy of one, picked up at a bookstall in
Edinburgh some years ago, bears the title:
“The Monastery, a Romance. By the Author
of ‘Waverley.’ In Four Volumes. Zwickau,
printed for the Brothers Schumann. 1824.”
It is actually in two volumes—1 and 2
being together, but each of the four has
separate title and steel frontispiece. There
was also published, in 1825, a German romance
called “Walladmor,” which was impudently
ascribed to Sir Walter Scott. Presumably
the long-continued anonymity regarding the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
authorship of the Waverley Novels encouraged
the publisher of this book to hope for
a successful sale.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sir Walter Scott in his eagerness
to purchase land for his Abbotsford
estate, and to fill the mansion with antiquarian
and historical curios, brought together
with persevering industry and at
great cost, was continually in need of money
to carry out his plans. Abbotsford eventually
became a show-place, and at the same time
a kind of hotel, where the greatest men
of Europe were proud to be received and
to partake of his hospitality. In 1820
Scott received the baronetcy for which he
longed, as an aristocratic badge for the new
Border family he had the desire to found;
and soon after he figured as director of
the pageantry in welcoming George IV. to
Scotland. The sums which he spent in these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
ways were great; nor could he have reconciled
himself to such outlays, except from
the conviction that his genius was a mine
upon which he could draw whenever he
pleased. For much of this expenditure
he resorted to Constable, who, acting as a
sort of literary broker, took the author’s
genius and popularity in pledge for advances
to him. It would have been better for
all concerned had Constable, as well as
the Ballantynes, been less accommodating
on these occasions, for it was, no doubt, the
command of ready money that induced Scott
to launch out into extravagant schemes.
His purchases of land were the talk of the
whole district around Melrose and Selkirk,
and it was a common saying among the
rustics, “that they would wish for no
ampler fortune than just the length and
breadth of themselves in land within half
a mile of the Shirra’s house.” Some in
the neighbourhood shook their heads doubtfully
over it all, and one adjacent proprietor,
whose property Scott envied, told
him that “he wouldna be surprised if he
lived to see the craws bigging in the braw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
lum-heads.” But author, printer, and publisher
seemed alike intoxicated with the success
of the Waverley Novels, and the nature
of their dealings was perhaps without parallel
in literary commerce. Not to speak of the
extravagant remuneration for books already
before the public, and of advances for books
in progress, it afterwards appeared that large
sums were drawn for works which, if contemplated,
were at least not begun. To add
to all these difficulties, Scott was led by
a feeling of gratitude to grant Constable
counter-acceptances, in order to relieve him
from those embarrassments of which he himself
was the chief cause. The complications
of all these transactions, precipitated by a
commercial panic, brought on at last a complete
crash. At the end of January 1826,
the firm of Archibald Constable &amp; Co. was
declared bankrupt; shortly after, the failure
of James Ballantyne &amp; Co. was announced;
and with these houses that of Hurst, Robinson
&amp; Co., of London, was hopelessly involved.
The market was stocked with the dishonoured
bills of the firms, and confidence in the great
publishing houses was ended. Scott himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
was involved in something like £130,000,
between publishers and printers.</p>

<p>In all this Scott, not James Ballantyne,
played the leading part. In a letter of
October 15, 1815, referring to the failure of
his brother’s bookselling business, and equally
applicable to this new imbroglio, the printer
writes to Scott: “I am singularly and hopelessly
ignorant in these matters; but I fancy
the truth is that, owing to the bad success of
the bookselling speculation, and the injudicious
drafts so long made on the business
that throve, I am, <i>de jure et de facto</i>, wholly
dependent on you.” It would appear that
James Ballantyne was right in this—that the
trouble arose not through any incompetence
on the printer’s part, but mainly through the
setting up of the firm of John Ballantyne
&amp; Co., and the speculations of the publishing
firms.</p>

<p>“Scott was always incurring expenses,
often heavy expenses, for other people.
Thus, when Mr. Terry, the actor, became
lessee and manager of the Adelphi Theatre,
London, Scott became his surety for £1250,
while James Ballantyne became his surety for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
£500 more, and both these sums had to be
paid by Scott after Terry’s failure in 1828.
Such obligations as these, however, would
have been nothing when compared with
Sir Walter’s means, had all his bills on
Constable been duly honoured, and had not
the printing firm of Ballantyne &amp; Co. been
so deeply involved with Constable’s house,
that it necessarily became insolvent when
he stopped.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Scott’s share of the large sum involved by
the failure was ultimately paid in full by
himself and his representatives, while the
other firms paid their creditors about ten per
cent. of the amount due. It must be kept
in mind, however, so far as Constable’s house
was concerned, that their property appears
to have been foolishly sacrificed by forced
sales of copyrights and stock.</p>

<p>The printing-office at Paul’s Work in
those days was as complete in all its
arrangements as any one of the inimitable
volumes which issued from it; and no
printed book was put into the binder’s hands
till the sheets were thoroughly dry and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
ink was fully “ripened.” The business was
vigorous, and, as we have seen, in 1822 no
fewer than 145,000 volumes issued from the
Ballantyne Press, all from the pen of Scott—an
extraordinary number of volumes in
those days of hand-presses; and this leaves
out of reckoning work done for other authors
and publishers.</p>

<p>The manager of the working departments—Mr.
Hughes being now more in connection
with the counting-room—was Daniel
M’Corkindale. He never spoke above a
whisper, nor stirred out of his quiet
manner, and yet, under his control, every
man and boy performed his task with despatch
and the regularity of clockwork.
M’Corkindale was part and parcel of that
office—visit it at what hour of the day or
night you pleased, there you found him;
and even on a Sunday he would take the key
and flit noiselessly among the untenanted
case-frames and silent presses. James Hogg
called him the honest and indefatigable
M’Corkindale. After thirty years of faithful
service, he died in March 1833, two
months after his master.</p>

<p>Mr. James Bertram, editor of the <i>North
Briton</i>, published in 1893 “Memories of
Books and Authors,” which contained the
following notice of the Ballantyne Press in
1837-38: “I had often occasion to visit
Paul’s Work, where my friend, Mr. R. H.
Patterson, afterwards editor of the <i>Edinburgh
Advertiser</i>, was one of the ‘readers.’ Ballantyne’s
was an office in which many ‘characters’
were to be found, including ‘the
Major,’ Mr. Cartwright, an accomplished
printer’s-reader; Mr. Christie, one of the
foremen; and William Tofts, one of the
machinists. These men had all known Sir
Walter, Mr. Lockhart, Mr. Constable, Mr.
Blackwood, Professor Wilson, and others of
the bright spirits of <i>Maga</i>. One of the
old ‘pigs’<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> of the house delighted to tell us
stories about Sir Walter, ‘stories that Mr.
Lockhart kent naething ava aboot.’ He
maintained that he knew who wrote the
novels ‘almost as soon as the master’ (Mr.
James Ballantyne). When asked how that
came about, he would tell his best tale with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
a sufficient amount of importance; and although
it was credited in the office, I cannot
guarantee its accuracy. ‘I had just begun
(he would say) to a new sheet of “Guy
Mannering” one night a while after twelve—we
were working late in the press-room at
that time—and all the compositors had left,
when in comes Mr. Ballantyne himself, with
a letter in his hand and a lot of types. “I
am going to make a small alteration, Sandy,”
he said, “just unlock the forme, will you?
I’ll not keep you many minutes.” Well, I
did as I was bidden, and Mr. B., looking at
the letter, altered three lines on one page and
one line on another. “That will do now, I
think, Sandy,” were his words; “but first pull
a sheet till I see.” The master then looked
carefully over the two pages and said, “Bring
me the printed sheets—they’ll have to be
destroyed,” and off he went, never thinking
that he had left the letter lying on my bank.
I had barely time to get a glimpse at it, when
back came Mr. Ballantyne, but I kent the
hand weel, and the signature, and it was
“Walter Scott.” I had a great lang ballant
(ballad) in Sir Walter’s ain hand o’ write at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
hame, so that I was nae stranger to it. I
would hae likit to see what the difference was
that was made in the sheets, but he made me
carry them up to his room. So you see,
gentlemen, I kent the grand secret, when it
<i>was</i> a secret.’”</p>

<p>On William Tofts’ death in 1859 the following
notice appeared in the <i>North Briton</i>:
“Mr. Tofts was, in some respects, a remarkable
man. He had been associated with the
mechanical department of the printing trade
for nearly half a century, and during that
period had witnessed many eventful changes.
When he first went, as a boy, to learn the
pressman’s trade, the neat hand-presses now
in use were not known, and printing by steam
was not even dreamt of. The presses then
in use were of cumbrous construction, and
in place of rollers, the ink was distributed
over the surface of the types by means of
pads, with which the formes were dabbed
over. The work of improvement had begun,
however, and printing by means of hand-presses
was shortly afterwards brought to
the state of perfection in which we now
find it.</p>

<p>Used by Ballantyne in Printing the Waverley Novels</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Tofts was engaged in the office of
the Messrs. Ballantyne in the palmy days
of the Waverley Novels, and printed off
several of the impressions of that immortal
series of fictions. He well remembered
Sir Walter Scott, who made frequent visits
to the office where Mr. Tofts, then a very
young man, was engaged; and he had
also vivid recollections of Jeffrey, Lockhart,
Sydney Smith, and the other great guns
of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. He was the first
man who superintended a steam printing-machine
in Scotland—it was, if we remember
rightly, on the first introduction of one
of these valuable aids to book-making in
Messrs. Ballantyne’s establishment. He also
had the distinction of inaugurating a steam
machine for printing <i>Chambers’s Edinburgh
Journal</i>.”</p>

<p>In appearance James Ballantyne was a
gentleman of the old school. It was a
treat to see him do the honours of his own
house in St. John Street, whether in the
drawing-room before dinner, showing the
proof-sheets of Scott’s poems or novels, bound
up with the marginal correspondence between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
the critic-printer and the author, or after
dinner, pressing his guests to a particular glass
of Burgundy, “a present from his friend Sir
Walter.” The prop of his existence was his
connection with Scott; the happiest moments
of his life were those that he spent—while
the Waverley Novels were appearing in
rapid and dazzling succession—amid a small
circle of friends, when the eagerly-expected
volumes were produced, a week or a fortnight
before they were issued to the general public.
James Ballantyne read them aloud with his
best emphasis and expression, and for this duty
he was admirably qualified, being a good
elocutionist, and possessed of a melodious
voice. There was to the listeners a certain
gratification in forestalling the rest of the
world—in being able to tell their friends
mysteriously that there was a great treat
awaiting them. There was much pleasure
also in discussing the merits of the work,
with timid allusions to the veiled author,
whose name was never mentioned. And
amid the circle sat James, the founder of
the feast, happy in the happiness he was
creating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>Lockhart gives a vivid description of
one of these evenings: “To be present at
one of these scenes,” he writes, “was truly a
rich treat.... When the cloth was drawn,
the burly preses rose, and spouted with a
sonorous voice the formula of Macbeth:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent28">“‘Fill full!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I drink to the general joy of the whole table!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This was followed by ‘The King—God bless
him!’ and second came ‘Gentlemen, there is
another toast which never has been nor shall
be omitted in this house of mine—I give
you the health of Mr. Walter Scott, with
three times three!’... Then James rose
once more, every vein on his brow distended,
his eyes solemnly fixed upon vacancy, to propose,
not as before in his stentorian key, but
with bated breath, in the sort of whisper
by which a stage conspirator thrills the
gallery—‘Gentlemen, a bumper to the immortal
Author of “Waverley”!’ The uproar
of cheering, in which Scott made a
fashion of joining, was succeeded by deep
silence; and then Ballantyne proceeded to
lament the obscurity in which his illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
but too modest correspondent still
chose to conceal himself from the plaudits
of the world—to thank the company for
the manner in which the <i>nominis umbra</i>
had been received—and to assure them that
the Author of ‘Waverley’ would, when informed
of the circumstance, feel highly delighted,
‘the proudest hour of his life,’ &amp;c.
The name of the forthcoming novel would
then be given, and success to it pledged in
another bumper.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>For a number of years James Ballantyne
conducted and printed the <i>Edinburgh Weekly
Journal</i>, with a degree of spirit and good taste
which the public did not fail to appreciate.
This paper began originally in 1744, and was
edited, about 1767, by William Smellie, well
known in the printing profession and first
editor of the “Encyclopædia Britannica.”
In 1806 the paper was exposed for sale,
when Mr. Blackwood and another offered
£1830 for it, but it became the property
of James Ballantyne and Walter Scott for
£1850, and under their joint ownership<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
was one of the most influential papers of
the time.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>“Christopher North,” in an early number
of <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>, characterised the
<i>Journal</i> as “one of the best principled and best
written newspapers in Scotland.” During
James Ballantyne’s editorship it was noted also
for its theatrical criticisms, the work of the
editor, who had previously contributed similar
articles to the <i>Edinburgh Evening Courant</i>.
His brother John looked after the musical
notices, being considered one of the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
critics of the day in this special direction.
Scott furnished many articles for its columns,
such as “The Visionary,” in December 1819
and January 1820, three essays on popular
doctrines or delusions of the time, afterwards
collected into a pamphlet which had a large
sale; and also the Malachi Malagrowther
Letters, already referred to, which also appeared
in pamphlet form.</p>

<p>James Ballantyne continued to be editor of
the <i>Weekly Journal</i> till his death in 1833.
His successor was Thomas Aird, the author
of many poems and prose articles which first
appeared in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>, and the
valued friend of Thomas Carlyle; but he
held the post only for a short time, being
chosen editor of the <i>Dumfries Herald</i>, then
newly started. The <i>Journal</i> continued to be
printed at Paul’s Work till 1844, when it
was again sold. It ceased to exist in 1848,
its last editor being Theodore Williams.</p>

<p>The following letter from Scott to Ballantyne
refers to a strike among the men, regarding
some extra work in connection with
the <i>Journal</i>, which they had refused to do
unless at a higher rate than usual:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear James</span>,—I heard of your mutiny.
We will help you all we can, and I advise
you to stand firm, and punish ringleaders.
The men are fools. The work would be
easily printed in London. I return two Bellendon
books—‘History of James VI.,’ and
‘Melville’s Memoirs,’ borrowed from you by
yours truly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">W. Scott</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <i>Saturday</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Connected with Ballantyne’s editing of the
<i>Weekly Journal</i> there is the following curious
story. The speech of George IV. at the
banquet in the Parliament House, Edinburgh,
1822, was reported in the <i>Weekly Journal</i>;
but it happens that, though that version of
his Majesty’s speech appears in all the works
published at the time (not newspapers), it is
not his Majesty’s speech at all, but James
Ballantyne’s, so far, at least, as the concluding
part is concerned. A reporter belonging
to the <i>Courant</i> happened to be sitting beside
Ballantyne on the occasion, and was
invited by him, when the feast was over, to
accompany him to St. John Street that he
might look over his notes. The reporter went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
with him, and wrote out the royal speech
in his presence. On reading the concluding
sentences of the speech, Ballantyne exclaimed:
“Ay, ay! his Majesty did say so;
but it is not good—we will improve it!”
With that he took his pen, cancelled what
was written, and substituted the sentences
which have always passed current as his
Majesty’s. This is a tolerable specimen of
Ballantyne’s ready tact in this way.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>On two occasions, however, the <i>Journal</i>
threw a shadow between the two friends,
which must have been painful to Scott, whose
warm regard for his confidential critic and
trusted friend was no secret. The paper
adopted the popular side during the trial
of Queen Caroline, and afterwards espoused
the cause of the Reform Bill. On neither
of these points could Scott’s high Toryism
permit him to be silent. He urged the
right of control belonging to a proprietor,
whilst Ballantyne replied by insisting on
the right of free action by an editor. The
first dispute was got over, but that on the
Reform Bill had a painful end. “The two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
old and faithful friends parted in a tiff, and
never again met.” So completely had the
long friendship been broken that, when Sir
Walter began his “Castle Dangerous,” about
June 1831, he told Cadell the publisher about
his new work, but said nothing to his old
ally, and even thought of giving the book
to another printer. This severity, however,
was too much for his genial nature.</p>

<p>James Ballantyne, equally with his partner
in the collapse of 1826, as told in this chapter,
was a ruined man; everything he possessed—including
his house, No. 3 Heriot Row, to
which he had removed from St. John Street—being
surrendered to his creditors. Fortunately
for all concerned a trust-deed was
drawn up, and he was chosen to manage
Paul’s Work for the creditors at a salary of
£400 a year. He was assisted by his younger
brother, Alexander, and by John Hughes—son
of the Mr. Hughes who came with him
from Kelso; and these two afterwards became,
with James’s son, John Alexander Ballantyne,
the active partners in the business.
To add to his misfortunes his wife died
in 1829, leaving a large family. In 1816,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
when forty-five years of age, he had married
Miss Hogarth, of Berwickshire, sister of
George Hogarth, author of “A History of
Music.” Their household was a happy one;
Mrs. Ballantyne was an amiable woman of
simple habits, and the children were pleasant
and well-mannered. Her death affected him
so much that for some time he was unfit for
business, and his health was impaired. He
was never the same buoyant, happy man
again. Scott writes regarding this event:
“I received the melancholy news that James
Ballantyne has lost his wife. With his
domestic habits the blow is irretrievable.
What can he do, poor fellow, at the head
of such a family of children! I should
not be surprised if he were to give way to
despair.” He was not able to appear at the
funeral, and this circumstance evoked much
sympathy.</p>

<p>In the same year we find him residing
in Albany Street. Some time after he removed
to Hill Street, and here he died
on January 17, 1833. Shortly before this
event, he had expressed a hope that he
might yet be restored to sufficient health,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
to enable him to place on record all he felt
and knew regarding the great and good
Sir Walter, who had so recently gone before
him. Accordingly, one of the last acts of
his busy life, when lying on his deathbed,
was to write and send to Lockhart the
Memorandum of which the latter made such
full use in his “Life of Scott,” and in return
for which he thought it not inconsistent
with the courtesy of a gentleman to traduce
the character of the writer.</p>

</div>

<p>On the 21st September 1832 Sir Walter
Scott died, and four months later James
Ballantyne followed him to that bourne
“where the petty politics of terrestrial powers
no longer inflame men’s minds, and the sound
of discord and disagreement is not heard.”
The following obituary notice appeared in
the <i>Scotsman</i> of January 19, 1833:—</p>

<p>“It is with feelings of sincere regret that
we have to announce the death of our able
and excellent contemporary and friend, Mr.
James Ballantyne. His health for several
months past has been very delicate, and he
expired on Thursday at noon, rather unexpectedly
by his friends, as he had fallen into
a soft sleep in the morning, after a night of
painful suffering from a vomiting of blood,
with which he had of late been visited.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ballantyne has been so long and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
honourably distinguished in his connection
with the press of Scotland, in the highest
acceptation of that expression, that we cannot
forbear alluding slightly to the leading points
of his life and character in that connection.
He began his career by establishing the <i>Kelso
Mail</i> in his native town; and it was while
he was thus engaged, that, in consequence of
some suggestion from Mr. Hughes, then and
long after in his employment, he made some
successful attempts to improve the typography
of Scotland. In these the success which
attended his efforts was so conspicuous as to
attract the notice of some distinguished individuals,
and, amongst others, that of his
illustrious friend, Sir Walter Scott; and a
new era in Scottish typography, as well as
of Scottish literature, was ushered in by the
printing of the ‘Border Minstrelsy’ at the
Border press. Mr. Ballantyne’s well-merited
fame for elegance and accuracy as a printer
soon extended in the marts of literature, and
the encouragement which he received from
the booksellers of London and Edinburgh induced
him to remove to this city about the
year 1802; and it is no disparagement to any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
of his brethren to state that, from the time
that Mr. Ballantyne devoted himself to the
pursuit, the art has been improved among us
to the highest pitch, for nothing in typography
can exceed the beauty and accuracy which
have ever characterised the productions of the
Ballantyne Press. These qualities are known
to the whole world in the works of his
illustrious friend, Sir Walter Scott, and they
were the result at once of the most conscientious
and scrupulous vigilance over his
press, and of an exquisite taste and great intelligence
which were applied to the works
entrusted to his superintendence. The intimate
connection which subsisted betwixt Sir
Walter and Mr. Ballantyne from their schoolboy
days—the confidential nature of that connection—and
the unceasing kindness which
was veiled only by the shadows which darken
all human friendships in the grave, were such
as to associate the name of Ballantyne with
that of his much-loved and honoured countryman,
and to invest it with consideration and
honour. During the last fifteen or sixteen
years Mr. Ballantyne has been the editor, and
a proprietor of the <i>Edinburgh Weekly Journal</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
which has been uniformly distinguished for
its candour, sound constitutional principles,
moderation, and independence. In private life
Mr. Ballantyne was amiable and gentlemanly
in his demeanour, accomplished, courteous,
cheerful; and to have been the intimate
associate of Walter Scott, John Leyden, James
Grahame, Robert Lundie, was of itself a proof
not merely of his intellectual superiority, but
of what is more estimable, of his moral worth.
He was a dutiful son, brother, husband, father,
and friend; and the affectionate qualities of
his nature will be long remembered by those
who moved within the circles of his friends
or his friendships.”</p>

<p>On the death of James Ballantyne his
trustees examined his repositories in the printing-office,
and found a number of fragmentary
portions of the manuscripts of the novels,
as well as numerous proof-sheets with corrections,
and several manuscripts of the later
novels which had been overlooked. These
fragmentary leaves and proof-sheets remained
in possession of the trustees till James Ballantyne’s
son came of age; and the latter, on
formally taking up his position at the printing-office,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
presented some of them to friends
as memorials—among others, the MS. of
“Old Mortality” was presented to Mr. (afterwards
Sir) John Cowan of Beeslack. The
state of the business, however, led a few years
after to sequestration, and the rest of the
Scott relics, as well as James Ballantyne’s
library, were sold for behoof of the estate by
Mr. Dowell of Edinburgh, in May 1848.
Among the lots sold at this time were the
MS. of the “Black Dwarf,” and the author’s
proofs of the “Life of Napoleon” (nine vols.),
“Woodstock,” “Nigel,” “Quentin Durward,”
“Ivanhoe,” “Peveril,” &amp;c., as well as the
author’s interleaved copy, with many notes,
of the “Letters on Demonology,” &amp;c., realising
altogether £121, 13s. 6d.</p>

<p>These proof-sheets contained the notes and
letters which passed between the author and
the printer, as well as the author’s corrections
and additions during the progress of the books
through the press. The suggestions and
remarks of Ballantyne are many, and occasionally
curious; and Sir Walter appears
frequently to have adopted the advice of
his friend, who for his occasional strictures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
was sometimes playfully designated “Tom
Telltruth.” “The proof-sheets of ‘Redgauntlet’
exist,” says Mr. Lang in his Introduction
to that novel, “and show some
noteworthy points, as we see Mr. James
Ballantyne’s suggestions, Scott’s corrections,
and an occasional aside to Ballantyne....
James objects to the mixture of ‘thou’ and
‘you’ in Fairford’s letter, but Scott does
not make any change.... Ballantyne
rather timidly suggests that Green Mantle at
the fishers’ dance reminds him of Di Vernon,
so Scott slightly modifies her cavalier tone.
James is scandalised at the mention of young
advocates as ‘boys.’ Scott writes, ‘Aye,
aye!’” The printer makes a “useful suggestion,
which Scott accepts, when Alan reads
the wrong letter in the trial.”</p>

<p>The author and the printer often differed,
and other replies of Scott to his corrector are
characteristic, as the following, which appears
in one of the proofs of “Woodstock”:
“‘Completing’ wants a nominative,” says
James. “You certainly have had the toothache,”
says the author in reply; “why, it
puts me in mind of the epigram when Pitt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
and Dundas came drunk into the House of
Commons:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘I cannot see the Speaker, Hal, can you?’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Not see the Speaker! d—n me, I see two!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On another occasion Sir Walter says in
his “Journal” (January 11, 1826): “I got
proof-sheets, in which it seems I have repeated
a whole passage of history which had been
told before. James is in an awful stew,
and I cannot blame him.... However, as
Chaucer says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘There is na workeman</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That can bothe worken wel and hastilie;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This must be done at leisure parfitly.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It must be admitted that Scott was occasionally
careless, partly because he could save
time by allowing others to correct his errors
and inconsistencies resulting from rapid composition.
For example, in “The Antiquary”
he makes the sun set in the German Ocean;
in the “Legend of Montrose” he uses in one
place westward where it should be eastward;
in “Kenilworth” the text has “In the employment
both of Burleigh and Cecil,” but
Burleigh and Cecil are one and the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
person, and it should probably read Walsingham
and Cecil; in “Anne of Geierstein”
in two places Nancy is used instead of Aix.</p>

<p>The proof-sheets of “Peveril” were sold
in London some time in the middle of last
century and bought by an American. They
afterwards formed part of an article in
<i>Scribner’s Magazine</i> (February 1889) on Sir
Walter Scott and his works, from which
several of the instances are here given:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Proof.</i> ‘He was never visited by any doubt.’ Note by
J. B. See p. 127, where this doubt is strongly expressed by
him. Scott thereupon alters to—‘any permanent doubt.’</p>

<p>“<i>Proof.</i> ‘The cutler agreed.’ Note by J. B. He
had gone downstairs in the last sentence. Scott hurries
him back, and alters to ‘the cutler returns at this summons
and agreed.’</p>

<p>“<i>Proof.</i> Motto to Heading to Chapter VIII. J. B.
This motto is repeated in the next chapter. Scott alters to
‘My native land, good-night.—<span class="smcap">Byron.</span>’”</p>
</div>

<p>So it goes on throughout, and there are also
such marginal remarks by Ballantyne as these:
“Imperfect;” “Incomplete;” “Incorrect;”
“This is inimitable in all respects;” “Capital!
there is something new under the sun;”
“Unintelligible and probably incomplete;”
“This is almost magnificent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>Many of the proof-sheets still existing show
that the author and the printer remained the
best of friends, even under the pressure of
financial troubles, till the unfortunate differences
arose in regard to the political views
of the <i>Weekly Journal</i>. They leave no doubt
that James Ballantyne by his courageous
and unprejudiced criticism pointed out many
an error which the reviewers would have
seized upon with eagerness. Referring again
to this subject, Mr. Lang, in his “Life of
Lockhart,” says: “Why, one is inclined to
ask, why with Lockhart at his side did Scott
turn to Ballantyne for criticism? The truth
probably is that in Ballantyne, comparatively
uneducated and ignorant of things which
one supposes everybody to know, Scott
thought he had a measure of the ordinary
taste, and a judge who would never veil his
actual opinion, nor ‘seek for a glossy periphrase.’”
“Comparatively uneducated and
ignorant of things!” This is said of one
who not only passed but practised as a
solicitor, and whom Scott himself—surely a
sufficient judge of his ability—recommended
for the editorship of a proposed new paper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
(November 1819), as “a thoroughly well-principled,
honourable man.... He writes
a good enough style, and has often been
happy in his opening articles.” Even stronger
testimony regarding James Ballantyne and the
<i>Weekly Journal</i> occurs in an entry in Scott’s
“Journal” (December 18, 1825), “for sure
they cannot find a better editor.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Moore<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> describes Scott’s marvellous labour
and power of composition, as well as the
extent to which he had carried the art of
book-making. “Besides writing his history of
Scotland for Dr. Lardner’s ‘Encyclopædia,’”
he observes, “he is working at the prefaces
for the re-publication of the Waverley Novels,
the ‘Tales of a Grandfather,’ and has still
found time to review Tytler, which he has
done out of the scraps and chips of his other
works. A little while ago he had to correct
some of the proofs of the History of Scotland,
and, being dissatisfied with what was done,
he nearly wrote it over again, and sent it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
up to the editor. Some time after, finding
another copy of the proofs, he forgot that
he had corrected them before, and he re-wrote
these also and sent them up, and the editor is
at this moment engaged in selecting from the
two corrected copies the best parts of each.”</p>

<p>In spite of all the printer’s care and personal
supervision, however, Sir Walter sometimes
had the chance of giving James “a
Roland for his Oliver,” as the following
letter testifies:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear James</span>,—I return the sheets of
‘Tales,’ with some waste of ‘Napoleon’ for
ballast. Pray read like a lynx, for with all
your devoted attention things will escape.
Imagine your printing that the Douglases,
after James II. had dirked the Earl, trailed
the royal safe-conduct at the <i>tail</i> of a <i>serving
man</i>, instead of the <i>tail</i> of a <i>starved mare</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>So printed in the first edition, but corrected
in subsequent editions to “a miserable
cart jade.”</p>

<p>The accompanying facsimiles are from proof-sheets

their reproduction. One shows the title-page
of a volume of the “Life of Napoleon,”
while the other is a page of the same work,
with Sir Walter’s corrections, and one of
James Ballantyne’s remarks. The playful
missives sent by the author to his printer
have been already referred to, and there
is to be seen along with the MS. of
“Rob Roy,” and bound up with the last
proof-sheet, the following note to James
Ballantyne:—</p>

  </div>
</div>

of friends. Pray send me two or three copies

<p>The allusion to its being a “tough job”
refers to the labour of producing the book in
his shattered state of health in 1817, the year
of the publication of “Rob Roy.”</p>

<span class="smaller">LOCKHART AND THE BALLANTYNE CONTROVERSY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Into the merits of the disputes which
arose over the disastrous business transactions
it is not necessary, perhaps, to enter at
length. What is brought together here is
mainly drawn from materials left by contemporaries
of the persons immediately concerned.
Recent criticism has not supported
Lockhart’s view that Scott was unaware how
things were going, and it has never been
explained how a man, so exact about his
personal expenses, could have been so careless
in his commercial dealings as partner in a
printing firm. Lockhart was well known
in literary circles to be a pungent critic,
and his severity as a reviewer gained for
him the name of the “Scorpion.” His
studiously insolent tone and his wilful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
misrepresentations led to the publication by
James Ballantyne’s trustees of “The Refutation
of the Misstatements and Calumnies
contained in Mr. Lockhart’s ‘Life of Sir
Walter Scott’ respecting the Messrs. Ballantyne.”
This was followed by “The Ballantyne
Humbug Handled” from Lockhart;
and this again was answered by a “Reply to
Mr. Lockhart’s Pamphlet. By the Authors
of the Refutation.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp61" id="illus19" style="max-width: 35.9375em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>JOHN GIBSON LOCKHART, LL.D.</p>

<p>PAINTED BY SIR FRANCIS GRANT P.R.A.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A review of these pamphlets in <i>Tait’s
Magazine</i> for 1839 states that Lockhart “had
done gross and, everything considered, pitiful
injustice to Mr. James Ballantyne; but, in our
opinion, the case stood still worse as to Dr.
John Leyden, Thomas Pringle, the Ettrick
Shepherd, Alister Campbell and other men of
genius, who had no sons or friendly trustees
to do justice to their true characters, and
defend their memories from clumsy ridicule,
and wanton and unprovoked misrepresentation....
The editor of the <i>Quarterly</i> (Lockhart)
has been as condescending in the free use
of abusive and insolent language, and in
calling names and giving nicknames, as the
veriest Grub Street author could desire;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
and, all the while, this vulgarity is directed
against persons whom he assumes to treat
as immeasurably his inferiors. The trustees,
whether tradesmen or professional men, though
sufficiently acute and cutting at times, have
a manifest advantage over Mr. Lockhart,
in never abandoning that decent propriety of
language which they owed to themselves, if
not to their supercilious and unceremonious
adversary; while they have carefully and
ably elaborated every point in Mr. Lockhart’s
statements, and knocked them down one by
one....</p>

<p>“For the unfounded assertions in the
earlier volumes regarding the Ballantynes,
Mr. Lockhart makes a sort of <i>amende honorable</i>:
‘I have been entirely mistaken, if those
to whom I allude (Ballantyne’s relatives), or
any other of my readers, have interpreted
any expressions of mine as designed to cast <i>the
slightest imputation upon the moral rectitude</i> of
the elder Ballantyne. I believe James <i>to have
been from first to last a perfectly upright man</i>;
that his principles were of a lofty stamp—<i>his
feelings pure even to simplicity</i>.’... It was
sufficiently proved from the documents given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
in the controversy that on all occasions he
(Scott) made use of James Ballantyne &amp; Co.
as the means of supplying his wants. If he
wanted money, and they happened to have
it, he drew it out; if not, he made use of
their firm to raise it. Such was his uniform
practice, from the first formation of the
company to the last day of its existence.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>John Gibson Lockhart died at Abbotsford
on the 25th November 1854, in his sixty-first
year. “In a letter addressed to me,” says
Dr. Charles Rogers, “a few days afterwards,
Mr. Robert Chambers referred to the
event in these words: ‘It is melancholy to
think of Lockhart sinking at sixty—and all
through heart-break. Sir Adam Ferguson
feels assured that such is the remote but
true cause of his death. He was perhaps
the least amiable man of letters I ever knew;
but these considerations make his departure
somewhat touching.’</p>

<p>“Naturally a cynic, Lockhart was latterly
prone to irritation; he possessed that unhappy
temperament which magnifies trifles
and distorts judgment. His perversity is in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
a measure illustrated by his harsh treatment
of James Hogg; it was wholly unexpected
by the Shepherd’s family, who supplied him
with papers, and to whom his visits had
(as Mrs. Hogg assured me) been frequent
and cordial. But Archibald Constable and
the brothers Ballantyne he cruelly wronged.
By Sir Walter Scott they were loved and
trusted; and his biographer had no cause
to heap censures on their memory. That
Sir Walter’s character might appear bright
and pure, it was unnecessary that his associates
should be charged with baseness.</p>

<p>“The detractor succeeds at the outset.
Lockhart, who, as has been shown by an
unprejudiced witness, Mrs. Gordon, in the
life of her father (Christopher North), was
not unwilling to inflict pain, succeeded in
deeply wounding the families of Constable
and the Ballantynes. But the day of reparation
came. The Ballantynes were vindicated
at once, and the censorious vehemence
with which Lockhart returned to the charge
invoked wide disapproval. In 1873 appeared
a memoir of Archibald Constable by his
son; in the third volume of that work the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
great bookseller obtains full and complete exculpation.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott contributed not only capital
to the firm, but great literary influence, which
attracted a copious supply of work to the
Ballantyne Press; yet the other partners were
not very far behind him in their influence
upon the business. In addition to some
capital, James Ballantyne brought what in
many ways was as important, experience in
literary matters and great talent as a practical
printer, while John’s pleasant manners and
social accomplishments must have gained not
a few customers for the house. It cannot
be denied that Sir Walter had a chief share
in maintaining the firm, for he always insisted
that his own works should be printed
there, no matter who the publishers were;
but he was also largely responsible for the
collapse, owing to those unsuccessful publications
previously referred to, which through
his influence had been printed by the firm.
Moreover, his excessive desire for family
aggrandisement and his profuse baronial hospitality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
were extremely unfortunate for all concerned;
and before the collapse came he
had spent £29,000 on land alone, while his
expenditure on house and grounds was estimated
at £76,000.</p>

<p>The following observations are from one
who was acquainted with all the circumstances:
“It is a curious instance of Lockhart’s
moral obtuseness that he could make
some most painful and needless disclosures in
regard to Scott himself in that Life (of Scott),
to say nothing of his foul and elaborate misrepresentation
of the Ballantynes throughout.
To that evil deed it is necessary only to refer;
for the confutation immediately published was
so complete, and the establishment of the fair
fame of the Ballantynes so triumphant, that
their libeller had his punishment very soon.
Some lovers of literature and of Scott still
struggled to make out that the Ballantynes
and their defenders, as tradesmen, could know
nothing of the feelings, nor judge of the conduct,
of Scott as a gentleman. The answer
was plain: the Ballantynes were not mere
tradesmen; and if they had been, Scott made
himself a tradesman, in regard to his coadjutors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
and must be judged by the laws of
commercial integrity. The exposures made
by the Ballantynes and their friends of Scott’s
pecuniary obligations to them were forced
upon them by Lockhart’s attacks upon their
characters and misrepresentation of their conduct
and affairs. The whole controversy was
occasioned by Lockhart’s spontaneous indulgence
in caustic satire; and the Ballantynes
came better out of it than either he or his
father in-law.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Another of Lockhart’s charges was that
of professional incompetence, made not from
his own knowledge, but on the conjectural
statements of Robert Cadell, the partner of
Constable and afterwards his supplanter in
the publication of the Waverley Novels.
This objection mainly rested on the assertion
that James Ballantyne had not been trained
as a printer, but it need count for little.
Neither Caxton nor Chepman, nor yet Baskerville,
all of them celebrated typographers,
received the education of a printer; and of
how many printer-capitalists of the present
day can it be said that they have been subjected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
to the technical training of a skilled
workman? This, however, may be better
answered from some notes by Dr. Robert
Chambers, a printer and a publisher,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> who
personally knew both Scott and the Ballantynes.
He maintains that Scott watched
closely over all the arrangements, was cognisant
of the most minute transactions, and
alone planned all the necessary ways and
means for carrying on the business. He says
further that “the printing business, which
was James Ballantyne’s legitimate work, was
always prosperous, and we can say with
equal confidence from what we have ascertained
through our own experience, and that
of friends, that his printing-office was decidedly
the most ably and carefully managed
for all ends with which its customers had
to do in Edinburgh.” And Mr. R. P. Gillies,
in his “Recollections of Sir Walter Scott,”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
observes regarding James Ballantyne: “A
character of more sterling integrity, or more
friendly disposition, never existed. As he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
by no means of an over-sanguine temperament,
it is possible that by following his advice the
subsequent embarrassments might have been
avoided.”</p>

<p>Again, as late as 1897, the <i>British Weekly</i>,
in noticing Leslie Stephen’s article on Scott
in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> of April that year,
says: “Although nothing will ever explain
Scott’s extraordinary recklessness, one comes
nearer to an understanding when reading
that Scott drew from the Ballantyne business
in four years £7000 for building at Abbotsford,
£5000 for his son’s commission, and nearly
£900 to a wine-merchant. Altogether it appears
that during the four years (1822-1826)
Ballantyne &amp; Co. had paid on Scott’s account
£15,000 more than they had received from
him.”</p>

<p>This chapter may be concluded with Sir
Walter’s own testimony to James Ballantyne.
In his “Journal” under date of December 18,
1825, he writes: “Ballantyne behaves like
himself, and sinks his own ruin in contemplating
mine. I tried to enrich him indeed,
and now all—all is gone.” In a letter
to Lockhart, January 20, 1826, Scott again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
exonerates James Ballantyne from being a
primary cause of his misfortunes, and says:
“It is easy, no doubt, for any friend to blame
me for entering into connection with commercial
matters at all. But I wish to know
what I could have done better.... Literature
was not in those days what poor Constable
has made it; and with my little capital
I was too glad to make commercially the
means of supporting my family.... I have
been far from suffering by James Ballantyne.
<i>I owe it to him to say that his difficulties as well
as his advantages, are owing to me</i>.” We have
here the crux of the whole matter; and
with this manly admission on the part of
Sir Walter a painful controversy may now
be allowed to rest.</p>

<span class="smaller">THROUGH OLD PAUL’S WORK, CANONGATE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In the early years of last century, when the
New Town of Edinburgh was beginning
to show itself along the northern slopes of
the valley of the Nor’ Loch, beneath the
Castle and the High Street, all the printing-houses
were to be found either down the
closes or lanes or in some blind alley approached
from the High Street or the Cowgate. The
precincts were frequently noisome with the
dirt and rubbish of long-past years. The
building itself would have a peculiar odour
of its own—a combination of rancid oil,
mouldy paste, and printer’s ink, and few
people would ever care to pass that way
except on business. The printing-office would
probably be located in what had at one time
been a private dwelling-house, and rendered
serviceable by the removal of partitioning
walls, the erection of narrow winding stairs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
and the joining of several apartments of
neighbouring houses into one, not infrequently
on varying levels.</p>

<p>Paul’s Work was entered by a small courtyard
with an iron gateway leading to a
narrow door immediately below an outside
stair. This stair led to the counting-room,
adjoining which was the room allotted to
Sir Walter Scott on his visits. The window
of this room is shown in the accompanying
illustration.</p>

<p>In those days work began at either six or
seven in the morning—the “devils” having
been there an hour earlier for sweeping and
cleaning. There was an hour, from nine
to ten, for breakfast, a healthy arrangement
long since given up under the pressure of
modern business, which tends more and more
to fewer breaks in the day—although the
removal of work-places to suburban districts
may also have had much to do with this
change. The workmen now make their appearance
at eight, and the dinner interval is
from one to two, instead of from two to three
as in former days.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp51" id="illus21" style="max-width: 17.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus21.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>ENTRANCE TO THE OFFICES OF OLD PAUL’S WORK</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Close by the entrance-doorway sat the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
time-keeper, a post long held by Mr. Smith,
an old grey-headed man, father of Alexander
Smith the poet, author of “A Life Drama,”
and for some time Secretary to Edinburgh
University. Passing upwards by devious
stairways to what was known as the “long
case-room,” here one would find about thirty
or forty compositors, busily dipping their
fingers into cases of types—spelling, capitalising,
and punctuating line after line from the
manuscript or “copy” before them—amidst
the joke and chaff flying among themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
and the noisy hammering of wooden “mallets”
at the imposing tables or “stones” down the
centre of the room, on which the “formes”
of type were being corrected and got “ready
for press.” A second case-room, with about
twenty men, was on another, higher flat;
adjoining this, in course of time, was the
stereo foundry.</p>

<p>Beyond the long case-room, on a slightly
different level, was a fairly large room, partitioned
off like so many sentry-boxes, occupied
by that much-maligned but indispensable
class, the printer’s Readers, each with his
attendant satellite or “devil.”</p>

<p>The Reader’s duty is not only to see that
the punctuation and the spelling are correct,
but also to make a note of interrogation
against any passage which appears doubtful
or incomplete. Some authors profit by these
unobtrusive queries; others resent them and
snub the Reader.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Though not exactly perfect,
he bestows much time and patience over his
work, and the general correctness of books
shows that his labour is not in vain. With
all his care and anxiety, however, errors will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
creep in—it is a moot point whether an
absolutely correct book was ever published.
It is curious, too, that the most obvious
blunders are sometimes passed by a painstaking
and careful Reader, as if to show that
experienced watchfulness is liable to occasional
defeat; for example, there is the case of one
Reader who passed for press as accurate a
work of reference in which were quotations
from many languages, yet overlooked an error
on the title-page, though there the types were
even larger. Some of the “devils,” or reading-boys,
whose duty it was to read the MS.
aloud while the Reader marked the errors on
the proofs, used to attain by long practice
exceptional ability in deciphering the vilest
“copy,” and the compositor occasionally
availed himself of their aid in a difficulty.
But since typewriting has come into general
use, illegible copy is comparatively rare.</p>

<p>Further up the stairs, beyond the Readers’
rooms, were other case-rooms, one for the
“jobbing” department and another known
as “The Garret,” containing about twenty
persons, where the case apprentices were
trained by experienced men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>While the formes were being prepared for
press, the damping-room below was called
into operation. It was here that the paper
to be printed was damped, in order that it
might take on better the impression from
the type. This process is now almost abandoned,
except in the case of some special
make of paper, as printing papers are now
made with a texture which does not require
damping. In the early days of Paul’s
Work, however, it was very necessary.</p>

<p>The formes of type and the paper being
ready, the pressmen put the formes on the
press-bed, and after “making ready” the pages
of type to ensure a uniform impression and
colour on the printed sheet, proceeded to
work off the formes. In the early days of
last century, before the advent of the steam-printing
machine, the work of the hand-pressmen
must have been a constant strain
on their physical powers. A “token” of
250 sheets per hour was the ordinary output;
they had to lay the sheet of paper
on the tympan and roll it under the press,
pull the bar to take the impression, roll
back, and lift off the printed sheet—all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
this for 250 times an hour for ten or twelve
hours each day was no light task. In those
days also, prior to the invention of the
hand-roller, the ink had to be put on the
formes of type by means of hand-balls or
“dabbers”; and this, too, took a much
longer time. The sheets of a book having
been thus printed, either by hand-press or
by machine, were next sent to the drying-room,
and hung over horizontal bars, one
above the other, being put up or taken down
by means of long peels. When thoroughly
dried the sheets were subjected to a smoothing
process between highly-glazed boards under
great pressure, and were then ready for the
bookbinder.</p>

<p>What would a publisher of the present day
say to the following? “The printing of
‘Sir Tristrem’ will be finished about the
end of June; if you approve, it ought to
lie two months before it is hot-pressed, and
it could be published about the middle of
October.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The press-room was on the ground-flat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
which on the introduction of steam-printing,
about 1817, became the machine-room.</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter mention may be
made of a kind of democratic court common
to every printing-house. This is called the
“Chapel,” and its membership comprises
all the journeymen. This “Chapel” is said
to have originated in the time of William
Caxton in one of the chapels at Westminster,
and has thus an antiquity coeval
with the beginning of printing in Britain.
A Chapel meeting may be called at any
time, either to preserve the employer’s property,
or to settle a dispute regarding prices
to be paid for special kinds of work. It
is presided over by an experienced workman
known as the “Father of the Chapel,” and
its meetings are convened by another known
as the “Clerk”; and any delinquent found
guilty by his peers of a trespass or fault may
be subjected to a fine, from which sentence
there is no appeal. Should he decline to submit,
he may be “sent to Coventry,” a position
which he will find very uncomfortable. One
Chapel dispute regarding the <i>Weekly Journal</i>
has been already referred to, but a previous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
one in 1803 may be noticed here, as told in a
letter of Sir Walter Scott to Miss Seward:—</p>

<p>“On my return, I find an apologetic letter
from my printer, saying the third volume will
be despatched in a day or two. There has
been, it seems, a meeting (? mutiny) among
the printers’ devils; also among the paper-makers.
I never heard of authors <i>striking
work</i>, as the mechanics call it, until their
masters the booksellers should increase their
pay; but if such a combination could take
place, the revolt would now be general in all
branches of literary labour.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Various other terms were in use in those
early days of Paul’s Work, but of these only
two need be noticed here—the “bullet” and
the “qui.” Both refer to somewhat similar
results—the “qui” being a contraction for
<i>quietus est</i>, when a workman was suspended
for lack of work, implying that he might be
reinstated when work became more plentiful;
the “bullet,” again, denoted a discharge
on the spot, owing to some misconduct or
fault, for which he was “shot” out of the
office altogether.</p>

<span class="smaller">END OF OLD PAUL’S WORK</span></h2>

</div>

<p>James Ballantyne was not in good
health for some years before his death in
1833. During that time, as we have seen,
he was assisted by his brother Alexander
and by John Hughes, son of the Mr. Hughes
who came from Kelso to Paul’s Work. John
Hughes, beginning as a compositor, was
afterwards taken into the counting-room to
aid in the control of the business, and in
this position he continued till the death of
James Ballantyne. When the trustees opened
Ballantyne’s will, they found a letter instructing
them to continue John Hughes in
that position till the testator’s son, John
Alexander Ballantyne, came of age, and if
the business were conducted to their satisfaction,
John Hughes was then to receive a
substantial interest in the firm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>For a number of years the firm of Ballantyne
&amp; Hughes was fairly successful. About
the year 1850, however, it got into trouble,
the causes for which were not far to seek.
For one thing, a centralising movement had
been going on for some time. Many literary
men were finding it necessary to live
in London for library and other consulting
facilities, and the work naturally followed
with the editors and the contributors. The
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, for example, which had
been printed for a number of years at Paul’s
Work, was removed to London, for the convenience
of the editor.</p>

<p>Other causes also were at work. The
population of Edinburgh and Leith about the
time of Scott’s birth in 1771 was probably
not more than 70,000; at his death in 1832
it was reckoned at about 140,000. Thus
during his lifetime the number of inhabitants
was doubled, and these had to find room elsewhere
than in the crowded streets and wynds
of old Edinburgh. The New Town across
the valley was rapidly growing down the
slopes of the northern hills of the city, and
many of the wealthier inhabitants and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
the old legal firms had already crossed, and
other large businesses were following. This
led to the withdrawal of much work and
traffic from the old town; whilst, again, the
starting of the Blackwoods as printers of
their own books, which began with the
January number of <i>Maga</i> in 1847, took
away from Paul’s Work not only that publication
but also the <i>Journal of Agriculture</i>,
the various editions of Alison’s “History of
Europe”—which kept the old office lively
for a long time—and other works. <i>Tait’s
Magazine</i>, another Edinburgh periodical of
good standing, was also taken away. All
these and other similar changes, in the
absence of a counter-current of local supply,
were sufficient to weaken any business.</p>

<p>The firm, however, had foreseen the
coming evil days, and made an effort to
avert the serious consequences of the change
in the tide of business. In 1846, a branch
office was started at 3 Thistle Street, which
soon became a successful little place, where
a large amount of Court of Session work was
done, as well as the printing for some of the
Edinburgh insurance offices. John A. Ballantyne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
took charge of the branch business
till John Hughes purchased the property and
stock at Thistle Street. The former remained
connected with the business at Paul’s
Work till his death in 1863.</p>

<p>Various changes took place after this.
Work was increasing beyond the limits of the
old Paul’s Work, owing to the influence and
energy of one of the partners, Mr. Edward
Hanson, resident in London, who revived
the connection which existed in the early
days of James Ballantyne, and gave a great
impetus to the printing of books in Edinburgh
for London publishers. Mr. Hanson
was born in Cleveland in Yorkshire, and as
a youth went to Edinburgh in 1857 to enter
the publishing house of Mr. James Nichol.
Mr. Nichol was at the time engaged in the
issue of a complete edition of the British
Poets, in forty-eight volumes, edited by the
Rev. George Gilfillan, and also an edition of
the Standard Divines. Both of these series
were printed at the Ballantyne Press, and
Mr. Hanson became acquainted with Mr.
John A. Ballantyne, the last of the family
to enter the business. This friendship led<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
eventually to Mr. Hanson joining the Ballantyne
Press. After John A. Ballantyne’s
death a partnership was formed by Mr. James
Cowan, M.P., Mr. J. D. Nichol, and Mr.
Hanson. In 1875 Mr. Nichol retired from
the firm, and was followed in 1879 by Mr.
Cowan, leaving Mr. Hanson sole partner.
In the financial arrangements requisite on the
retirement of Mr. Cowan, Mr. Hanson was
assisted by his friend Mr. Francis Logie
Pirie, of Tottingworth Park, Sussex, who
became and remained for some years a partner
in the Press. Mr. Hanson subsequently
assumed as partners his nephew, Mr. R. W.
Hanson, in Edinburgh, and Mr. Charles
M’Call in London, and with their assistance
has materially developed the old business.
A third generation of the Hanson family
has recently joined the firm in the person
of Mr. Edward Taylor Hanson.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus22.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>WINDOW IN PAUL’S WORK OF THE PRESENT DAY</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As the neighbouring encroachments of the
North British Railway station prevented any
extension of old Paul’s Work, plans were
made for accommodation in better quarters.
These were found at Clare House, lying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
between Findhorn Place and Causewayside.
Many of the larger printing-offices have,
within the last thirty years, removed their
premises to the more commodious outskirts
of the city, and Paul’s Work was among the
first to lead the way in this respect by its
removal, in December 1870, to the Newington
district.</p>

<p>In 1878 Mr. Hanson acquired the printing
business of Saville, Edwards &amp; Co., Chandos
Street, and thus the firm secured for itself a
habitat in London. He was fortunate in
having for his manager Mr. Horace Hart,
now Controller of the Oxford University
Press. This branch removed to Tavistock
Street, Covent Garden, in 1888, and there
carries on the printing of several Magazines,
as well as a considerable amount of Book
production. In 1905 it was converted into
a private limited company under the name
of Ballantyne &amp; Co., Limited, the shares
being chiefly held by the old firm. In 1908
the firm experienced a great loss in the
death of Mr. M’Call. His son, Mr. C. H.
M’Call, has succeeded to his position.</p>

</div>

<p>Various causes render a bibliographical
chapter a difficult matter. Lapse of
time, enlargements of premises, removals,
and changes of several kinds incident to
an old business, have led to the loss of
records which would have been of great
value in a chapter of this kind. Apart from
the works of Sir Walter Scott—of which we
give a chronological list, we can only hope
to describe a few of the books printed
by James Ballantyne &amp; Co. in the earlier
decades of Paul’s Work. It may be noted in
passing, however, that much of the early
work of Carlyle was printed there, particularly
his “Miscellanies,” which include the
famous essay on Burns.</p>

Graham Dalzell took the volume published in 1806,

<p>Hector Macneill (1746-1818) was a popular
poet and song-writer. He had a varied experience
in life, and showed his poetic ability by publishing
in 1789, “The Harp, a Legendary Tale,” which
brought him into favourable notice. His most
popular poem, “Scotland’s Skaith, or The History
of Will and Jean,” appeared in 1795, and its
sequel, “The Waes o’ War,” was almost equally
successful. All Macneill’s works are in the
Scottish dialect. The copy here noted is the
second edition (12mo); the first (8vo) was issued
in 1801.</p>

<p>“The moral of Will and Jean was admirable,”

London. 1807.”</p>

<p>James Beattie (1735-1803) first published a
volume of poems and translations in 1760, which
he afterwards tried to suppress, though the book
had been favourably received. The work which
brought him most prominently into notice was “An
Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth,”
written to refute the scepticism of Hume; and it
also gained him a Government pension of £200 a
year. “The Minstrel” is Beattie’s best poem, and
it will continue to be read when his philosophical
productions are forgotten. His poems were again
printed at Paul’s Work in 1854, in Nichol’s
“British Poets.”</p>

<p>At an early age Falconer became a sailor on
board a Leith merchantman, and in his eighteenth
year was wrecked in the <i>Britannia</i> off Cape Colonna,
only three of the crew being saved. He was again
wrecked with the <i>Ramilies</i>, when only twenty-six
escaped out of a total of 734. After a period on
shore, during which he published several poems, he
joined the <i>Aurora</i>, and sailed for India in September<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
1769. The vessel touched at the Cape, but was
never heard of again, and was supposed to have
foundered in the Mozambique Channel. “The Shipwreck”
is his best work, and is believed to embody
his experiences in the wreck of the <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>Two neatly-printed little volumes, each containing
a Glossary of Scottish words at the end. “The
Sabbath” first appeared in print in 1804, and was
published anonymously. So careful was the poet
regarding the authorship of this work, that he
exacted a promise of secrecy from the printer of
the first edition, whom he used to meet clandestinely
at coffee-houses for the correction of proofs, but
never twice at the same house.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Hamilton (1758-1816) was born in
Belfast of Scottish parentage, and is worthy of note

<p>Originally published in London in 1728, this
work was attributed to Dean Swift, but is now
known to have been written by Defoe. In Boswell’s
“Johnson” there is the following reference to it:
“Lord Eliot: ‘The best account of Lord Peterborough
that I have happened to meet with is in
Captain Carleton’s Memoirs.’ Johnson said he had
never heard of the book. Lord Eliot sent it to
him. Johnson was about going to bed when it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>

<p>The Bannatyne Club and its books took their
initiative from George Bannatyne, a merchant of
Edinburgh, who, during a time of great pestilence
in 1568, retired to a secluded house in Forfarshire,
and there employed his enforced leisure in making
a collection of old Scottish poetry, which might
otherwise have perished. “Bannatyne’s manuscript,”
says Scott, in a Memoir written for the
Club, “is in folio form, containing upwards of
eight hundred pages, very neatly and closely written;
and designed, as has been supposed, to be sent to
press.” Allan Ramsay borrowed from it the specimens
of old verse which appeared in his “Evergreen,”
a Collection of Scots Poems, which he
published in 1724; Lord Hailes issued another
selection in 1770; and in 1772 the manuscript was
presented to the Advocates’ Library by the Earl
of Hyndford. In 1822 the Club was instituted for
“the publication of substantial volumes illustrative
of the history, antiquities, and general literature of
Scotland.” Sir Walter Scott became president, and
regularly took the chair at its annual meetings from
1823 till 1831. During the period of its existence
till 1861, the Club published no fewer than 116
volumes, many of them printed at Paul’s Work.
They were all deemed of value, and one complete set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
was sold in 1887 for £235. The membership at
first consisted of thirty-one, but, owing to the desire
of many persons of rank and literary distinction to
join, it was gradually increased to one hundred in
1828, when it made a final pause. At the first
annual dinner of the Club, on March 9, 1823, Scott
wrote a song for the occasion to the tune of “One
Bottle More,” several verses hitting off the foibles of
various bibliophiles. This song was sung by James
Ballantyne, and heartily chorused by the company.</p>

<p>Three verses are here given:—</p>

<p>John Home (1722-1808) was a clergyman in
the Kirk of Scotland, who wrote several plays.
His most popular play was “Douglas,” a Scottish
romantic drama, in which maternal affection is
depicted under novel and striking circumstances—the
accidental discovery of a lost child; and Henry
Mackenzie, “the Man of Feeling,” here gives his
opinion that the chief scene, in which the preservation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
and the existence of the lost Douglas is
discovered, has no equal in modern and scarcely
a superior in ancient drama. The play was first
performed at Edinburgh on December 14, 1756,
and met with instant and brilliant success, but so
violent a storm was raised by the fact of a Presbyterian
minister so violating the rules of clerical
propriety as to write a play, that the author had to
succumb to the Presbytery and resign his ministry.
It is in “Douglas” that the well-known passage
occurs: “My name is Norval: on the Grampian
hills my father feeds his flock,” &amp;c.</p>

Princes Street, Edinburgh, and William Pickering,

<p>This old Scottish poet was born in East Lothian,
and after his education at the University of St.
Andrews became a Franciscan friar and travelled
through France, England, and Scotland as a mendicant
preacher. Little was known of his poems till
the beginning of the eighteenth century, though
several of them had been issued as tracts by the
first Scottish printers, Walter Chepman and Andro
Myllar, in 1508. Sir Walter Scott said: “Dunbar
was unrivalled by any poet that Scotland has yet
produced; he excelled in moral and humorous
verse, and was peculiarly happy in using allegory in
the advocacy of truth.”</p>

<p>There is evidence that Dr. Laing had a previous
edition of a portion of Dunbar’s poems printed at
Paul’s Work in 1827; but just as the volume was
completed, with the exception of the Introduction,
a disastrous fire occurred in the binder’s premises
which destroyed the greater portion of the sheets,
and only seventy-six copies (four on vellum) were
actually published, not a few bearing evidence of
the scorching they had sustained.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>“Constable’s Miscellany,” extending to seventy-six
volumes, was first printed by Willison (Constable’s
father-in-law), and after his death, for two years
by Hutchinson for Willison’s heirs, and then at
Paul’s Work by Ballantyne &amp; Co., who had also
given occasional aid in the production of the early
volumes. This series comprised books in all
branches of literature, such as Lockhart’s “Life
of Burns,” Robert Chambers’s “History of the
Rebellions in Scotland during the Seventeenth
Century,” 2 vols.; the same author’s “History of
the Rebellion of 1745,” 2 vols.; Basil Hall’s
“Voyages,” &amp;c., &amp;c. The first volume appeared
on January 6, 1826. The “Miscellany” was
“undoubtedly the pioneer and suggester of all the
various ‘Libraries’ which sprang up in its wake,
and which, after the inspiration and management of
its projector had been withdrawn, may be said to
have run it down.... ‘Constable’s Miscellany’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
also inaugurated the cloth bindings which are now
universally adopted in our own and other countries.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
The printing of the same publisher’s <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>, begun in October 1802, was done till 1806
by different printers—Mundell, Muirhead, Walker
and Son, and Moir. In 1807 Willison’s name
first appears and continues till his death, when
Hutchinson comes in for two years; and from 1827
till its removal to London it was printed at the
Ballantyne Press.</p>

<p>It is impossible to mention a tithe of the other
books which have passed through the Ballantyne
Press during the century and more that has elapsed
since its origin, and all that can be attempted here
is a reference to the outstanding publications which
have been printed at Paul’s Work. These include
several editions of the Waverley Novels, Shakespeare,
Browning, Dickens, Thackeray, Bret Harte,
Besant and Rice, Charles Reade, Mrs. Gaskell,
Charlotte Brontë, Thomas Hardy, Mrs. Sewell,
and others; various editions of Ruskin’s Works,

<p>A pleasant and memorable chapter in the
history of the Ballantyne Press is its connection
with the Edinburgh International Exhibition
of 1886, held in the West Meadows. The position
occupied by Paul’s Work relative to the literary
history of Edinburgh since the beginning of last
century, as well as other considerations, induced
the firm to make an exhibit of ancient printing
materials and of Early Bibles and other books in
the Old Edinburgh buildings of that Exhibition;
and to show a working model, so to speak, of an
early printing-house. This was considered to be a
very attractive feature of the Exhibition, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
following account of it appeared in the Scotsman of
September 15, 1886.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“THE BALLANTYNE PRESS IN ‘OLD EDINBURGH’</p>

<p>“Passing through the Nether Bow Port, and keeping
to the left, visitors to the Exhibition will come
upon the reproduction of an old house in Dickson’s
Close, now improved away, and supposed to have
been originally the work of Robert Mylne, the
builder of the modern portion of Holyrood, and
peculiar from its upper storeys and open galleries
projecting for several feet beyond the basement—a
not uncommon feature of the architecture of olden
times. This house, or a near neighbour to it in the
same ‘land,’ was at one time the abode of David
Allan, the Scottish Hogarth. Above the door is
an old-fashioned swinging signboard showing ‘Ye
Ballantyne Presse, 1796,’ while the windows are
adorned with stained glass. Here Messrs. Ballantyne,
Hanson &amp; Co., Paul’s Work, have gathered
together a goodly display of the old implements of
the ‘prenters,’ ancient Bibles and other books, as
well as a number of other curios.</p>

<p>“Prominent among the typographical antiquities is
a venerable wooden hand-press, nearly two centuries
old, and substantially identical with those used in
the early stages of the art. This press is worked
by a genial and chatty representative of Caxton, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
a neat sixteenth-century costume. He is engaged
printing off sundry jobs, using the old-fashioned
hand-balls or ‘dabbers’ for putting the ink on the
types, a method of inking which came in with the
art, and which was superseded by the modern ‘roller’
only about fifty years ago. Within the cases on the
counter of this old curiosity shop are to be seen
ancient composing-sticks, type moulds, punches,
matrices, &amp;c., for casting types. In the cases are
also a number of relative curiosities, lent for exhibition
by the Oxford University Press, and originally
the property of the celebrated Dr. Fell. Among
these is a small quarto book, printed in 1700,
containing the Lord’s Prayer in upwards of 200
languages. Here also is a parcel of Icelandic type,
given to the Oxford Press by Francis Junius about
1677, and some music type of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>“In one case is a proof-sheet of the ‘Life of
Napoleon,’ by Sir Walter Scott, with the author’s
corrections. One page of this proof-sheet, which
is the property of the Earl of Rosebery, has a
characteristic remark by James Ballantyne, the
printer, in reference to one of Sir Walter’s footnotes.
It was to be expected from the connection
the Ballantynes had with Scott that some
relics of the author of the Waverley Novels would
be shown, and here are to be seen the chair
and desk reserved for his use in Paul’s Work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
when he came to correct his proofs or transact
business.</p>

<p>“Around the walls are also to be seen a number
of pictures, among these being a copy by Maris
of Raeburn’s portrait of Scott; a proof copy of
the well-known engraving of Scott and his contemporaries;
Caxton in Westminster Abbey; old
views of Edinburgh, one of them dated 1579, &amp;c.
A remarkably fine etching shows the bookselling
shop of Jacob van Liesvelt at Antwerp in the sixteenth
century. Liesvelt was condemned and beheaded
at Antwerp, because in the annotations of
a Bible he had edited and printed, it was said that
‘the salvation of mankind proceeds from Christ
alone!’ A number of old playbills also adorn the
walls, some of these having portraits framed along
with them, such as that of Mackay as Bailie Nicol
Jarvie, Mrs. Siddons as Lady Randolph, and Mr.
Liston as Dominie Sampson. One old playbill
is shown of the Kelso Theatre, printed by Ballantyne
at the Border Press, before Scott induced
him to remove his printing-office to Paul’s Work,
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>“There are here a number of old newspapers—the
<i>Kingdom’s Intelligencer</i>, the <i>Perfect Diurnal</i>, the
<i>Courant</i>, <i>Caledonian Mercury</i>, &amp;c. One of the
<i>Diurnals</i> contains a despatch of General Monk,
dated from his headquarters at Dalkeith in August
1654; and a <i>Caledonian Mercury</i> of August 26,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
1822, contains a subscription list for the National
Monument on Calton Hill, and the <i>menu</i> for the
banquet given by the municipality of Edinburgh
to George IV. in Parliament House. There is
also an early number of the <i>Scotsman</i>, of 1855,
shown by way of contrast to the present issues of
the journal.</p>

<p>“To many visitors, however, the interest in the
Ballantyne Press exhibits will centre in the fine
collection of Ancient Bibles and other books which
have been gathered together. The gem of this
collection is a copy of the very rare ‘Mentelin’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
Bible, printed about 1466—one of the earliest
printed by the aid of movable type, in fine condition,
with initial letters filled in by the hand,
of beautiful design and colouring. The table of
contents extends to eighteen pages, and is all in
MS. of various colours. Another rare Bible is
the Hans Lufft, or first edition of Luther’s Bible
in two volumes, printed in 1534. This Bible is
in its original binding of wood with brass mountings,
and has a great number of woodcuts printed
along with the text, which in this copy were afterwards
coloured by hand expressly for the Prince
Protector. The existence of this Bible was frequently
denied by learned men of Germany, owing
to its great rarity, caused by the destruction of
most copies by the Roman Catholics. John George
of Saxony was unable to obtain it for himself,
and was obliged to be contented with the sight
of one, then supposed to be unique. A copy of
this work sold at a very high price at Lord Holland’s
sale in 1860. The engravings throughout
the work, and especially in the Revelation of
St. John, are curious and full of anachronisms—the
patriarchs and prophets being clad in the German
costume of the sixteenth century. Another
Lutheran Bible here is one printed at Nurnberg,
in 1720, by Andrea Enolters. This is said to be
one of the finest of all the ancient German Bibles,
and has, besides a number of beautiful engravings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
of Biblical scenes, several portraits of well-known
German princes. It is also in its original binding
with metal ornaments. A copy of the first edition
of the Paris printer Robert Stephens’ valuable Greek
Testament, in two volumes, published in 1546, may
also be seen. A former possessor has enriched
the margins of this copy with a copious supply
of Latin notes and comments in very small MS.
There were other editions of this book published
in 1549, 1550, and 1551. That of 1551, published
at Geneva, was divided into verses as we have the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Bible now, a plan which the printer Stephens was
the first to put into actual use.</p>

<p>“Of a more purely local interest, however, is a
copy of another Bible we find here, that of the
first one printed in Scotland, with the date of 1576.
This work, printed by Alexander Arbuthnot and
Thomas Bassendyne, has a history of its own. It
was put in type from the Genevan version, and has
the well-known ‘breeches’ translation of Genesis
iii. 7, and contains also the side-notes, to which
King James is said afterwards to have strongly
objected as ‘partial, untrue, and seditious,’ when
arrangements were being made for the Authorised
translation of 1611. Besides being connected with
the first Bible printed in Scotland, Bassendyne’s
printing-office, which was situated in a close nearly
opposite John Knox’s house, is repeatedly referred
to in the evidence of the accomplices of the Earl of
Bothwell in the murder of Darnley, an event which
took place in the lifetime of the old printer. In
the deposition of George Dalgleish, one of those
who were executed for their share in that crime,
it is stated that, ‘efter thay enterit within the
Nether Bow Port, thai zeid up abone Bassyntine’s
house, on the south side of the gait, and knockit
at ane dur beneth the sword slippers, and callit
for the Laird of Ormestounes, and one within
answerit he was not thare; and thai passit down
a cloiss beneth Frier Wynd, and enterit in at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
zet of the Black Friers.’ This reference clearly
indicates that Bassendyne’s workshop was situated
near the Nether Bow, whence was issued the folio
Bible which is here shown.</p>

<p>“Another Genevan or ‘breeches’ version, printed
by Christopher Barker in 1586, is also in the collection,
this one having the Book of Common Prayer
at the beginning. There is here, too, King James’s
own copy of the first edition of the Authorised
Version of 1611, printed by Robert Barker in black
letter. It is in fine condition, with the Royal arms
on the massive outside boards, and contains the
well-known and curiously elaborate genealogical
tables by John Speed. Taking thought for the
common people, King James is said to have given
orders that a smaller and cheaper edition of the
Authorised Version in Roman type should be prepared
in quarto size. This was also printed by
Robert Barker, and published in 1614, and is to
be seen here, along with many other Bibles, some
with curious bindings, and others with music to
the Psalms. Several of the more important of the
Bibles above mentioned have been lent for exhibition
by the Rev. Dr. Ginsburg of London.</p>

<p>“One of the most curious black-letter books in
the Ballantyne collection, and with an interesting
history, is a copy of the first complete Concordance
to the English Bible, written by John Marbek
(or Merbecke), and printed by Richard Grafton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
in 1550. This John Marbek was organist to the
Royal Chapel at Windsor, and his book bears the
following title: ‘A Concordance, that is to saie a
worke wherein by the ordere of the letters A. B. C.
ye maie redely finde any worde conteigned in the
whole Bible, so often as it is there expressed or
mentioned.’ Marbek, after various difficulties, had
gone on with his Concordance as far as the letter L,
when all his papers were seized, and he was apprehended
and imprisoned. ‘He was arraigned, for
that he had with his own hand gathered out of
divers men’s writings certain things that were expressly
against both the mass and the sacrament of
the altar. He was arraigned and condemned with
three others—namely, Anthony Persone, priest;
Robert Testwood, singing-man; and Henry Filmer,
tailor; on account of the Six Articles in the year
1544; the three last were burned at Windsor, but
the innocence of Marbek gained him the King’s
pardon.’</p>

<p>“When he was set at liberty, as his papers were
not restored to him, he had his Concordance
to begin again; and this, when completed, he
showed to a friend, who promised to assist him in
having it presented to the King, in order to have
it published by his authority; but Henry VIII.
died before that could be brought about, and it
was accordingly dedicated to Edward VI. This
folio black-letter Concordance gives a good specimen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
of the printer Grafton’s rebus or monogram, a <i>graft</i>
inserted into a <i>tun</i>.</p>

<p>“A number of other interesting curiosities, and
a library of ancient books, too numerous to be detailed
here, are in various cabinets and bookcases
in this shop of Old Edinburgh. Many of the
volumes are over 300 years old; several are in
their original bindings; and all are in fair condition.
Classics from the printing-presses of the Elzevirs,
Stephens, Gryphius, Foulis, Ruddiman, and other
printers whose names are now historical, are all to
be seen, besides a goodly array of fine art and other
books, the more recent productions of Messrs.
Ballantyne, Hanson &amp; Co.”—<span class="allsmcap">W. T. D.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> Many manuscripts of modern authors are execrable, and little
care is taken to make what is written plain and intelligible, resulting
in “errors of the press,” though, owing to the vigilance of
the press reader, comparatively few of these meet the eye of the
public. In the preparation of their “copy” lawyers of high
repute will leave technical and foreign terms in a truncated or
misspelt way; divines frequently show an aversion to both punctuation
marks and capitals, the omission of which would bring scorn
and contempt upon the compositor and the reader. Many instances
of faulty manuscripts could be cited. A few will suffice. A learned
professor in a northern university wrote in such a shocking spidery
hand that the men were paid a third more for putting it in type;
a divine, long since gone over to the majority, wrote his sermons
on any scrap of paper he got hold of—old bills, torn envelopes,
&amp;c.—and thus caused an infinity of labour in arranging these
oddments in a readable way. If any particular bit got transposed
from its proper place, it did not appear to matter very much; it
was as well there as anywhere else. Similar to this was a famous
writer, well known at Paul’s Work, who, prior to his morning
prowl among old bookshops, would fill his pockets with scraps
of paper—envelopes and such-like—on which he noted the
particulars of his daily finds; and these were afterwards sent to
the printer to be arranged for a book. Another reverend writer,
whose works were many and sold well, would take a quarto
sheet of paper to write on—beginning with a narrow centre
column for the first draft of his subject; to this would be
added afterthoughts by branching lines to the centre column, till
the whole sheet was full—like a rushing river gathering in fresh
supplies from meandering rivulets on either side of its course.
But this topic is a wide and curious one, and instances might be
given where an author was unable to read his own “copy,” and
had to see a proof of what could be set in type before he was able
to remedy an unreadable passage or supply an obscure or missing
word.</p>

At the sale of Dr. Laing’s library there was disposed of a number
of odd lots of pamphlets and papers, and amongst these a quantity of
undamaged sheets of the Ballads and Poems of Dunbar. Whoever
bought these was determined to make a profit out of them, for an
Edinburgh “book-hunter” discovered one day in a second-hand
bookseller’s shop a nicely bound gilt-top quarto volume, bearing
the title “Ancient Poetry of Scotland. Edinburgh, 1508,” and
having the device of Andro Myllar on it. Facing the title was
“Imprinted Glasgow, 1800. Limited to 50 copies, 10 on thick
paper, 1 on vellum.” The book looked tempting, and was bought;
but, to the bibliophile’s disappointment, it proved most fragmentary,
as it contained only a limited portion of the sheets of the Ballantyne
reprint several times repeated, irrespective of consecutiveness,
throughout the book, and many of the pages bore traces of the
accident which befell the original work.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
